<h3>March 2002: Plans for Gambit 0.97</h3>
Version 0.97 of Gambit has been under (irregular) development for almost
two years, and is nearing release.  Our current target release date is 
sometime in Summer 2002.  Some features of the new version:
<ul>
<li><b>Algorithms:</b> These algorithm enhancements will provide new, more
useful tools for computing Nash equilibria in games with three or more players.
<ul>
<li>A new path-following algorithm for computing quantal response equilibria,
based on a paper which can be downloaded from
<a href="http://econweb.tamu.edu/turocy">Ted's homepage</a>.  This algorithm
is capable of tracing the quantal response correspondence for much greater
values of lambda than before, making it possible to identify the limiting
point of the principal branch of the correspondence for most games.
<li>Implementation of Yamamoto's algorithm (IJGT, 1993)
for finding a proper equilibrium in a normal form game.
</ul>
<li><b>Interface:</b> The graphical interface has been completely reimplemented, moving from wxWindows version 1.68 to the current version of
<a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a> 2.xx.  The interface has
been reorganized to be more standardized.  Versions are under development
for both Microsoft Windows and Linux (using either the GTK+ or the Motif/Lesstif libraries).
<li><b>Command language:</b> The command language is largely unchanged
from the previous version.  A new graphical window interface to the
command language will be available on all platforms, replacing the
MFC-based Microsoft Windows interface in 0.96.  Additionally, a command-line
interface is available under Windows now for better batch-file support.
<li><b>PXI:</b> The PXI program for plotting and analyzing quantal
response equilibria has also been reimplemented with wxWindows 2.xx, with
a more modern and clean interface.  Improved features for experimental
data entry and manipulation are included.
<li>Additionally, many minor bugs have been squashed, and new features
added based upon feedback from users.
</ul>

Watch this space for more details on the release date.

<h3>November 28, 2000: Gambit 0.96.3 released</h3>
Bug fixes:
<ul>
<li>Null outcomes in normal form files are now correctly read.</li>
<li>Extensive form window sizes correctly in games with many multi-node
information sets.  (In previous versions, outcome payoffs could not always be
read in such games.)</li> 
<li>Chance probabilities are copied after infoset-cut.</il>
<li>The return type for the GCL function MoveToInfoset[] is corrected.</li>
<li>Emptied information sets are now automatically deleted in the
GUI when editing the extensive form.</li>
<li>The Unix Makefile has been modified to use $(MAKE) for its recursive 
calls.</li> 
<li>All parsers have been changed to work with bison, instead of bison++.</li>
<li>Linux binary now linked statically.  So motif need not be
installed locally to run the GUI.</li>
</ul>

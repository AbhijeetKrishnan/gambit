Building Gambit on un*ces:
--------------------------

On un*ces, Gambit is configured and built with the standard autotools
mechanism:

./configure
make
su
make install

Note that we do most of our development on Linux, so it is possible the
configure script is not doing enough checking for things that happen 
on other Linux flavors.  If you encounter compile problems, please report
them to us at gambit (at) hss (dot) caltech (dot) edu, or the 
gambit-devel mailing list, so we can address them.

Command-line options are available to modify the configuration process;
do `./configure --help` for information.  

By default, Gambit is installed in /usr/local.  You can modify this by
the --prefix option.  For example, if you wanted to install it in your
user account, you might do

./configure --prefix=/home/mylogin/gambit

The graphical interface would then be in /home/mylogin/gambit/bin/gambit,
and so forth.  (Obviously, you can omit the 'su' in this case.)

Gambit requires wxWindows 2.3.2 or higher to build.  However, we recommend
building with wxWindows 2.3.3, since it improves a number of things with
regard to using the grids for editing.  This primarily affects the outcomes
window and profile editing dialogs.

If wxWindows it isn't installed in a standard place (e.g., /usr or
/usr/local), you'll need to tell configure where to find it with the
--with-wx-prefix=PREFIX option, for example:

./configure --with-wx-prefix=/home/mylogin/wx

Technically, wxWindows 2.3.x is "unstable"; however, the features used
by Gambit seem to be stable enough to justify its use.  A new microversion
of Gambit will be released when wxWindows goes to 2.4.x (stable).

Finally, note that we work almost exclusively with the wxGTK version of
wxWindows.  There's no reason why one couldn't use the Motif/Lesstif version
in principle, but it is untested.  If you have success (or failure)
with the wxMotif version, please also let us know.


Building Gambit on Windows:
---------------------------

The Gambit distribution provides makefiles for Borland C++ 5.5.1.
These are in borland.mak in the sources directory and its subdirectories.
To build Gambit, you'll need to create a file sources/makedef.bcc to
point to your wxWindows installation and your Borland compiler installation.
For example, if you have wxWindows built in C:\WX2 and the compiler in
C:\BORLAND\BCC55, and you have the Gambit sources unpacked in C:\GAMBIT,
you would create a file C:\GAMBIT\SOURCES\MAKEDEF.BCC with the contents

WXDIR = C:\WX2
BCCDIR = C:\BORLAND\BCC55

Your system will doubtless vary; we do recommend installing both of these
in paths that have no spaces in the directory names.  Additionally, you
should make sure the compiler binary is in your PATH (e.g., $(BCCDIR)\BIN
in the example above).

Once you're set up, run

make -f borland

in the sources directory, which will recursively call the borland.mak
makefiles in the subdirectories.  Assuming everything builds OK, the
graphical interface will be in sources/gui/gambit.exe, and wxGCL will
be in sources/wxgcl/wxgcl.exe.

We don't know if Gambit will build with other compilers, though we
would graciously accept a contribution of makefiles and/or fixes for
other compilers.

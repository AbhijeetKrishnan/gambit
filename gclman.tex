\maketitle

\section*{General Overview}

The general purpose of the language is to allow the user to perform a series of
operations and procedures on games in extensive or normal form through a set of
commands.  The games can be randomly generated by a procedure within the
program, read into the program from external files, or created in extensive
form using the language.  Games created or contained in the extensive form can
be transformed into the normal form using a procedure within the program.

The language consists of a series of statements, each ending in a semi-colon
or carriage return.  A carriage return will not be interpreted as the end of a
statement, however, if there are unmatched parentheses or brackets.  For
example, the following two lines are interpreted as one statement:

\begin{verbatim}
	Output[1, 2]
\end{verbatim}

If both lines are followed by a carriage return, the statement will generate
the line of output: 

\begin{verbatim}
	1, 2
\end{verbatim}

The user has the option of creating a text file containing a series of commands
which can then be run together, as a program, by the language.  The output of 
such a program can be directed either to the screen or to a file specified by 
the user.  A text file can be read by the language as a program by placing an 
input file command {\tt "<"} followed by the name of the file, following the 
command which enters the command language.  By using an output file command 
{\tt ">"} followed by the name of a file, the user can direct the output of 
the command language to an external text file.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
	> gcl_sun < input.gcl > output.out
\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{Output}

Output can be produced by a program or command using the following command:

\begin{verbatim}
	Output[{expression1}, {expression2}, . . . ]
\end{verbatim}

The command produces a line of output containing the values or strings 
specified by the expressions.  An expression can be a variable of any type or 
can evaluate to any value or string which can be contained in a variable.  The 
brackets {\tt "{ }"} are not a part of the language and are used only to 
enclose expressions which are also not a part of the language.

\subsection*{Variables}

Variables can be defined and given a value using the {\tt ":="} symbol 
where the name of the variable is to the left of the symbol and to the right 
there is an expression which evaluates to a value of the type desired for 
the variable. A variable can be of the following types:

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{lp{4in}}
BOOLEAN & Boolean (evaluates to constants:  True or False)\\
INTEGER & Evaluates to an integer of arbitrary size \\
RATIONA & Evaluates to a rational number of arbitrary precision\\
TEXT	& String of arbitrary length enclosed in quotation marks\\
EFG	& Game in extensive form (created or read)\\
NFG	& Game in normal form (created or read)\\
NODE	& A node (may only be a subvariable of an extensive form
problem) \\
DATATYPE & Defines precision (constants:  Float or Rational) \\
MIXED	& {Profile of mixed strategies.  Can only be a subvariable of a
normal form problem.  That is, if n is a problem in normal form, a
variable of type MIXED can only be assigned to a subvariable of the
form n.x.}\\
BEHAV	& Profile of behavioral strategies.  Can only be a subvariable
of an extensive form problem.  That is, if e is a problem in extensive
form, a variable of type BEHAV can only be assigned to a subvariable
of the form e.x. \\
\end{tabular}

\medskip

\noindent
Additionally, variables of type  BEHAV, BOOLEAN, INTEGER, MIXED, RATIONAL, and 
TEXT can be contained in lists of arbitrary length.  Variables of type LIST are
defined similarly to the above variables, except that the expression to the 
right of the {\tt ":="} symbol contains a vector of variables of the same 
type enclosed in brackets and separated by commas.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
	LIST(BOOLEAN) := { BOOLEAN1, BOOLEAN2, . . . . , BOOLEANn }
\end{verbatim}

The elements of a list are indexed sequentially.  Therefore, the ith element of
a list is defined as:

\begin{verbatim}
	LIST(BOOLEAN)[[i]]	which evaluates to a single variable of type 
				BOOLEAN.
\end{verbatim}

\noindent
In the same manner, list variables of type LIST(BEHAV), LIST(INTEGER), 
LIST(MIXED), LIST(RATIONAL), and LIST(TEXT) can be created and accessed for 
variables of type BEHAV, INTEGER, MIXED, RATIONAL, and TEXT, respectively.

\subsection*{Flow Control}

Gambit Command Language also contains mechanisms which allow flow control 
within a program in one of three manners.

\medskip

\begin{tabular}{lp{4in}}
While [BOOLEAN, &\\
\{series of commands\}] & Evaluates the BOOLEAN
expression or variable.  As long as it evaluates to TRUE, the series
of commands are performed.  Each command must be followed by a
semi-colon or carriage return.  If the BOOLEAN evaluates to FALSE, the
loop ends without performing the commands.\\
If [BOOLEAN, & \\
\{series of commands\}] & Evaluates the BOOLEAN expression
once. If it evaluates to TRUE, the series of commands are performed.
Each command must be followed by a semi-colon or carriage return.  If
the BOOLEAN evaluates to FALSE, none of the commands are performed.\\
If [BOOLEAN, & \\
\{series of commands\}], & Evaluates the BOOLEAN expression
once. If it evaluates to TRUE, the first series of commands are
performed.  Each command must be followed by a semi-
colon or carriage return.  If the BOOLEAN evaluates to FALSE, the second
series of commands are performed. \\
NOTE: & The While command functions as a loop.  That is, it continues
to perform the series of commands as long as the expression
evaluates to TRUE.  The If statement, however, only performs the
series of commands once if the expression evaluates to TRUE.
\end{tabular}

\section*{Procedures}

The following is a list of procedures with the operations that they perform
in the Gambit Command Language:

Variable types in all capital letters indicate the type of the required
parameter or return value of the procedure.

The symbol {\tt "=:"} to the right of a procedure specifies the type of the 
return value (if any exists) produced by the procedure.

Paremeters enclosed in brackets {\tt "{ }"} represent optional parameters which
are not necessary for the procedure to function.

// We build a series of functions of increasing complexity.  The
// final one, which is our goal, is the undominated support function.
// We begin by simply enumerating all subsupports.

// Subsupports of a given support are _path equivalent_ if they
// agree on every infoset that can be reached under either, hence both,
// of them.  The next routine outputs one support for each equivalence
// class by outputting only those subsupports with _no_ active 
// actions at each unreached infoset.  

void AllInequivalentSubsupportsRECURSIVE(const gbtEfgSupport *s,

// The following routines combine to return all supports that do not 
// exhibit particular type of domination.  This was a prototype for 
// PossibleNashSubsupports, and displays the methods used there,
// but it does NOT do exactly what is advertised with respect to 
// weak domination.  This is because the recursion may eliminate
// an action that is weakly dominated at some stage of the truncation
// process, when, after more truncations, it might be no longer weakly
// dominated, and thus part of an allowed subsupport.

void AllUndominatedSubsupportsRECURSIVE(const gbtEfgSupport *s,

// The following two routines combine to produce all subsupports that could
// host the path of a behavioral Nash equilibrium.  These are subsupports
// that have no action, at an active infoset, that is weakly dominated by
// another active action, either in the conditional sense (for any active
// node in the infoset) or the unconditional sense.  In addition we 
// check for domination by actions that are inactive, but whose activation
// would not activate any currently inactive infosets, so that the
// subsupport resulting from activation is consistent, in the sense
// of having active actions at all active infosets, and not at other
// infosets.

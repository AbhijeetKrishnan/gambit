GUI Bugs:

//------------------------------

Bug D7:  Conflict with Netscape

When running the GUI, if netscape is already running, you may or may not
get the following message, (or something like it, depending on the
machine):

   X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
   Resource id in failed request:  0x0
   Serial number of failed request:  379
   Current serial number in output stream:  391

[ It is unlikely that it can be fixed because it's a known problem with 
wxWindows, but it can be avoided by running netscape with a private colormap
using "netscape -install". ]

//------------------------------

Bug D8:  LiapSolve does not keep partial solutions.  

When solving an extensive form game (try using the standard solution
setting of All Nash on e01.efg -- which puts you in an infinite loop
in liap solve), the code returns empty solutions when it is terminated
with the Cancel button.  This appears to be a problem in the subgame
soving code which appeared when we changed to exceptions for handling
the cancel event.  Here is some relevant correspondence

We have an additional parameter in the gui (seems like it should be in the
GCL also, but I don't see it there) which sets the maximum number of
solutions per subgame.  I thought this was supposed to solve this problem
by effectively putting the infinite loop at the top.  I thought this
should deal with the first problem too (games with no proper subgames.) 
But I will have to look at the code to see what this actually does. 
Perhaps it is not implemented correctly. 

//------------------------------

Bug D11: Scrolling problems

For both EFGs and NFGs, using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't affect the
scrollbar position and doesn't redraw the entire screen.

COMMENT (magyar 1/8/99): I don't experience this problem in the Windows
version at all, *except* when using the increase-magnification feature.
The cursor is not always visible on the screen immediately following a
zoom operation (but will become so after a move with the arrow keys)

//------------------------------

Bug D15:  Won't accept file name abbreviations

In fields requiring file names, the GUI will not accept the "~"
character or aliases.  For example, running QRE on poker.efg, the
following errors result, even though both
'~rdm/gambit/pxi/pxi_motif_Linux' and and 'newpxi' refer to valid
executable files, and run fine when entered from the command line.
 
  wxWindows: could not execute '~rdm/gambit/pxi/pxi_motif_Linux'
  wxWindows: could not execute 'newpxi'

COMMENT (magyar 10/2/98): Also a problem in the GCL.  Tilde-expansion
is a shell convenience, which is why it works on the command line.
We would need to add code to do this.  Not hard, we've just never gotten
around to doing it.

//------------------------------

Bug D17:  Need "in place" editing of outcomes for large games.  

This is really more of an enhancement than a bug.  

In the normal and extensive form, if the game is large, it takes a
long time to bring up the outcome window, and find the outcome
associated with a given location in the EF/NF game.  We should
have "in place" editing, where you can edit the outcome right on the
normal or extensive form dislpay.

For NFG, at least, here is a proposed interface:

The cursor can be placed anywhere on the text except on a comma separating
entries in the outcome.  Text can be entered or deleted; it will come up in
the same color as the text it is replacing.  Text cannot be added past a
comma, and the comma can't be deleted.  To get to the next entry in the
box, use tab; to get to the previous entry, use shift-tab.  Once at the end
of the box, tab will move the entry to the next box.  If at the last box in
the row, tab will move to the first box in the next row.  If in the last
box in the array, tab will move to the first box in the array.  Similar
rules hold for shift-tab in the other direction.  The arrow keys move the
focus to a different box.  It would be nice to have a visible insert
cursor, but this may be harder to achieve.

//------------------------------

Bug D20: PolEnum on extensive forms

  Although there is a menu item for this algorithm, it has not been
implemented in the GUI until a final decision is made whether it is
complete and stable enough for this release.

//------------------------------

Bug D21: Problems with progress displays

  No progress display for PolEnum algorithms.  

  Convert Caro2-efg to nfg, and run All Nash.  Hit Cancel on 
  progress display -- causes crash.

COMMENT (magyar 1/8/98): I was unable to reproduce this second problem
in Win95.

//------------------------------

Bug D26: Icons not correct. 

The icon that is displayed on the window manager and the file list for
the gcl and gui are frequently wrong (Gui should display gambit.ico
and the gcl should display gcl.ico.  Also, the icons displayed in the
upper left hand corner of the frames for the gui are not always
correct.  For example, the EF Gui should display efg.ico, and the NF
Gui should display nfg.ico.

COMMENT (magyar 3/5/98): Apparently a Win95 problem, according to the
wxWin documentation.

//-------------------------------

Bug D32: Warning message on Linux/wxxt port

When loading up 8x8.nfg in the wxxt version of gambit, we get this:

panel: cannot resize frame to ZERO width or height

No harm seems to come of this.

//--------------------------------

Bug D35: Field width too narrow on some dialog boxes. 

On File Save, the field for the decimal places is too narrow to see
the number.  There were other dialogs with similar problems.  Can't
recall them now.

//--------------------------------

Bug D36: Formatting of floating point numbers very bad 

On Liap and QRE algorithms, the formatting of the lambda and tolerance
parameters is bad.  We agreed to change the tolerance to an integer,
and the lambda parameters to text strings.

GUI Bug 5.2

> 2. Why the solution list window does not vanish from the upper right
> close button?

RDM: 8/20/99 Solution list window is fixed, but the
Edit->Strats->Label dialog box (and perhaps others as well) can not be
gotten rid of.  Also, after this window has been created, the main
Gambit window can be dismissed and the child windows do not get
dismissed.  (this is on Linux) N.B. the "close" button here refers to
the window manager close button.

RDM: 12/27/98 This bug is now fixed for most windows, but there are
still a few with the problem -- especially in the elimdom menu.

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.4,  Scrolling problems

> 4. When the main window for the tree design is not maximized the
> vertical and the horizontal bars are getting out of the screen.

RDM: Problem still exists 9/3/98.  Here are furhter details:

Scrolling is not correct: Eg(this is all on Linux): Load caro2.efg.
Hit +magnify button twice.  Move cursor R,R,D,R,R.  Notice how screen
does not always display cursor.  Now hit L,L,L,L, and try to get back
to the root node.  Again cursor moves off the screen, and the bottom
scroll bar does not help to move the window to display the cursor.

Also, the scroll bars require a complete redraw before the next scroll
bar hit is recorded. Load a big game like bayes2a.efg, andthen hit the
right scroll bar three times insuccession to try and scroll the screen
down.  It redraws the screen three times instead of halting the redraw
when the second and third hits to the scroll bar are made.  Also,
dragging the scroll bar does not work.  This makes it very time
consuming to move around a large gaem.


//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.6

> 6. In the edit behav Solution window the ? button seems to do nothing.

RDM: 9/3/98 On Linux, it gives the same problem as above, "wxWindows: could
not execute wxhelp"

[ This is not a bug.  The wxhelp program must be in the path and the
WXHELPFILES environment variable must be set to point to the directory
where the help files live. ]

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.7

RDM: 9/3/98 This is still a problem.  Look at Bayes2a, try and
remember what the game is supposed to look like (or bring up two
copies, one for comparison). Then hit +Magnify three times.  Now move
around the tree with the cursor, and eventually you will see this.

RDM: Still a problem.  This may be related to similar problems in EF
GUI (See above GUI Bugs 5.4 and 5.7)

RDM: Let's not worry about this one, except to give a general warning
in he documentation that there may be conflicts with other programs.

GUI Bug 8.1-8.2: XView, Transient bugs

I was not able to reproduce this.  I am assumintg this is under XView?

Your subsequent message indicates this is a transient problem of some
sort.  Let me know if there is any pattern to when it occurs.  

RDM: This looks like system stuff at his end to me.  We can't check it
out until we compile an XView version of new code.

GUI Bug 9:  Bad postscript files.  

On Tue, 23 Jun 1998, Bernhard von Stengel wrote:

Hi,

more apparent bugs. This time:  buggy generation of PS-Files.
This may be a bug in the wxwin package.

1.
When I generate large games, display fails altogether since
the scaling doesn't work.  I only see the initial part of a very
large tree.

2.
In some cases, parts of the tree are also DELETED when the PS
file is generated.  I presume this is due to faulty memory management,
but it can also be a GAMBIT bug.  It occasionally happened for smaller
games, but then it disappeared when the file was reloaded, so I could
reproduce it only for the large extensive form game.
To document this, I enclose by separate mail

a. The (level 8) generated tree which looks complete as a file.

b. The PS file generated from the GUI interface.

   In order to look at the PS file, I found a method to print it easily
   on an ordinary printer.  Namely, I enclose in this mail a latex
   file that assumes that the GUI-generated file is stored as

   efg.eps

   in the same directory.  Running it through latex, it then generates a
   single page where the game tree fits on a letter-size page, filling it
   maximally. The .dvi file has to be converted to .ps with  dvips,
   of course.  I found LATEX the easiest way to do this.

Regards, Bernhard

This is a Gambit BUG.  Or at least, I get the same problem running under
xview. It appears to be that the scroll is not working correctly under
XView. You can view the game in the zoom window (in prefs menu), but that
only shows the part near the cursor.  

Perhaps this is a problem in wxwin support of xview, as there is no
problem viewing the game under the motif version or the Windows version of
the GUI.

RDM: I reproduced this under version .94 on Xview.  we need to compile
the new code under Xview to see if this still exists.

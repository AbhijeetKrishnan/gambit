GUI Bugs:

//------------------------------

Bug D3: Bugs in Outcome interface

For the extensive form, the outcome window does not stay on top when you
select nodes while attaching outcomes to the game.

[ This is a window manager-specific property.  It can be changed on dtwm 
(Solaris CDE window manager) by setting the following options in your
.Xdefaults or .Xresources file, re-running xrdb on that file, and
restarting the window manager:

Dtwm*focusAutoRaise:    False

This means that the window that gets the keyboard focus will not raise
above other windows.  Other window managers have similar options.  In
Windows '95 the default is that the window with the focus is raised above
all other windows except its children, as I understand it.  I don't know if
this can be emulated on Unix systems. ]

[ Note: this may be doable within X: look up WindowGroup().  Also
check the fvwm man pages. ]

For the normal form, there are two outcome windows, one accessed by
Edit->Outcomes, and the other by double click (Ctrl click on Linux).
Why are there two different interfaces?  We should ditch the Ctrl-click
editing dialog and simply have it bring up the Edit->Outcomes dialog.

//------------------------------

Bug D5: Saving files

When you load a file (efg or nfg) in the GUI, it should remember the
directory you got it from, and next time you try and load a file, start the
file load menu in that directory, rather than starting in the same location
as it started the first time.

When saving a file in the GUI, it should remember the current
name of the file, and use the same name when saving the file. 

When overwriting an existing file, the GUI should always prompt
for a new label.

There are other instances of the File Selector dialog that should 
also be looked at to make sure they behave as expected.

RDM 12/29/98: most of the above is fixed now.  The only remaining
problems are that on unix, it does not prompt with the existing
filename, and when you exit the GUI after having made changes to the
game, it does not prompt you to save.

//------------------------------

Bug D7:  Conflict with Netscape

When running the GUI, if netscape is already running, you may or may not
get the following message, (or something like it, depending on the
machine):

   X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
   Resource id in failed request:  0x0
   Serial number of failed request:  379
   Current serial number in output stream:  391

[ It is unlikely that it can be fixed because it's a known problem with 
wxWindows, but it can be avoided by running netscape with a private colormap
using "netscape -install". ]

//------------------------------

Bug D8:  LiapSolve does not keep partial solutions.  

When solving an extensive form game (try using the standard solution
setting of All Nash on e01.efg -- which puts you in an infinite loop
in liap solve), the code returns empty solutions when it is terminated
with the Cancel button.  This appears to be a problem in the subgame
soving code which appeared when we changed to exceptions for handling
the cancel event.  Here is some relevant correspondence 

key:

We have an additional parameter in the gui (seems like it should be in the
GCL also, but I don't see it there) which sets the maximum number of
solutions per subgame.  I thought this was supposed to solve this problem
by effectively putting the infinite loop at the top.  I thought this
should deal with the first problem too (games with no proper subgames.) 
But I will have to look at the code to see what this actually does. 
Perhaps it is not implemented correctly. 

//------------------------------

Bug D11: Scrolling problems

For both EFGs and NFGs, using the arrow keys to scroll doesn't affect the
scrollbar position and doesn't redraw the entire screen.

COMMENT (magyar 1/8/99): I don't experience this problem in the Windows
version at all, *except* when using the increase-magnification feature.
The cursor is not always visible on the screen immediately following a
zoom operation (but will become so after a move with the arrow keys)

//------------------------------

Bug D15:  Won't accept file name abbreviations

In fields requiring file names, the GUI will not accept the "~"
character or aliases.  For example, running QRE on poker.efg, the
following errors result, even though both
'~rdm/gambit/pxi/pxi_motif_Linux' and and 'newpxi' refer to valid
executable files, and run fine when entered from the command line.
 
  wxWindows: could not execute '~rdm/gambit/pxi/pxi_motif_Linux'
  wxWindows: could not execute 'newpxi'

COMMENT (magyar 10/2/98): Also a problem in the GCL.  Tilde-expansion
is a shell convenience, which is why it works on the command line.
We would need to add code to do this.  Not hard, we've just never gotten
around to doing it.

//------------------------------

Bug D17:  Need "in place" editing of outcomes for large games.  

This is really more of an enhancement than a bug.  

In the normal and extensive form, if the game is large, it takes a
long time to bring up the outcome window, and find the outcome
associated with a given location in the EF/NF game.  We should
have "in place" editing, where you can edit the outcome right on the
normal or extensive form dislpay.

For NFG, at least, here is a proposed interface:

The cursor can be placed anywhere on the text except on a comma separating
entries in the outcome.  Text can be entered or deleted; it will come up in
the same color as the text it is replacing.  Text cannot be added past a
comma, and the comma can't be deleted.  To get to the next entry in the
box, use tab; to get to the previous entry, use shift-tab.  Once at the end
of the box, tab will move the entry to the next box.  If at the last box in
the row, tab will move to the first box in the next row.  If in the last
box in the array, tab will move to the first box in the array.  Similar
rules hold for shift-tab in the other direction.  The arrow keys move the
focus to a different box.  It would be nice to have a visible insert
cursor, but this may be harder to achieve.

//------------------------------

Bug D19: Problems with Standard Solution output.  

(magyar 1/8/98): I've removed the earlier list of problems for this
bug since they have been rectified.  However, what still needs done
is to make sure each combination is implemented correctly, and that
the implementation squares with the UDF's provided with the GCL.
For example, finding sequential equilibria in the extensive form
seems to be implemented by liap on the normal form, where it seems
to me it should be done on the *extensive* form.

>Note:
>  Rational precision should be greyed out in standard solution settings
>  where not appropriate

This probably isn't going to be feasible.  In order to do so, we'd
have to be able to change whether that box is enabled/disabled based
upon the current values of the other boxes, which doesn't seem to be
possible (at least the way it is implemented currently).

//------------------------------

Bug D20: PolEnum on extensive forms

  Although there is a menu item for this algorithm, it has not been
implemented in the GUI until a final decision is made whether it is
complete and stable enough for this release.

//------------------------------

Bug D21: Problems with progress displays

  No progress display for PolEnum algorithms.  

  Convert Caro2-efg to nfg, and run All Nash.  Hit Cancel on 
  progress display -- causes crash.

COMMENT (magyar 1/8/98): I was unable to reproduce this second problem
in Win95.

//------------------------------

Bug D22: Problems with outcome window

Sometimes, the focus from the outcome window is inexplicably lost,
going to the EF or NF window instead, and it is impossible to get it
back, even to dismiss the window.  

Note: -- The following comment in spread.h may provide a resolution to
these problems:

// Note: on some platforms (msw,motif?), after any item on the panel has been
// accessed, the keyboard focus switches to the panel.  This can cause
// undesirable behavior (i.e. can not enter data, arrow keys do not work). It
// is advisable to call CanvasFocus member after processing any panel item
// events.

//------------------------------

Bug D26: Icons not correct. 

The icon that is displayed on the window manager and the file list for
the gcl and gui are frequently wrong (Gui should display gambit.ico
and the gcl should display gcl.ico.  Also, the icons displayed in the
upper left hand corner of the frames for the gui are not always
correct.  For example, the EF Gui should display efg.ico, and the NF
Gui should display nfg.ico.

//------------------------------

Bug D27: Solution Numbering

Numbering of solutions should begin afresh when solutions are deleted
in the solution display windows

//------------------------------

Bug D28: Problems in converting to normal form in the gui

This problem only occurs under MS-Win version.  

Load poker.efg, convert it to reduced normal form, and then try to
save this as a normal form game (junk.nfg).  The gui crashes.
Similarly, if you try to solve the game with the QRE algorithm, the
gui crashes.

RDM: The above is now fixed (12/29/98)

//------------------------------

Bug D29: .efg and .nfg files not recognized in Linux/wxxt port of gambit

When you start up the gambit gui compiled with wxxt and try to load
either an nfg or an efg, you get an error window that says "Unknown
file type".  On the other hand, if you load the file from the command
line ("gui foo.efg") it works.

//------------------------------

Bug D30: "Inspect node" window comes up transiently in Linux/wxxt when
         efg is loaded.

This is a cosmetic bug only, but it's irritating.

//------------------------------

Bug D31: Default normal form game is buggy

The following sequence from the opening GUI window causes a crash:

  File->New->Normal->OK->OK->OK->Solve->Standard->(One-Nash-Rational)

Also, most other operations done on the default normal form game (like
trying to save it) cause a crash.

COMMENT (1/17/98, magyar): These specific ones have been fixed -- they
turned out to be problems with nfdom.cc and CompressNfg, respectively,
where NFOutcome::GetNumber() was called without checking to see if a
NFOutcome * was null.  I'm leaving the report here to make sure we
remember to check more thoroughly.  However, all the problems I tracked
down would also appear in the GCL, so this is more of a GCL bug than
a GUI bug, apparently.  (It is possible similar problems could occur
in the GUI as well though.)

//------------------------------

Bug D32: Sort/Filter does not work for Normal form solutions.  

None of the Sort/Filter functionality seems to work on the normal form
solution window.  All of the sort/Filter capabilities works
correctly on the Extensive form solution window.  The Normal form
functionality should match this.

Also, double clicking on the column heading in the solution window
does not sort the solutions by that column.  Also, the default
ordering of solution IDs is opposite of numbering in Extensive form
solution window.  The numbering in Extensive form solution window is
preferred ordering, since newly computed solutions are visible.

//------------------------------

Bug D33: Incorrect handling of games of imperfect recall.  

On Myerson.efg, EnumPure finds 2 solutions that it claims are Nash.
Also, standard Solution All Nash finds one solution that it claims is
Nash.  But the game has no Nash equilibria.  

In the same game, if you convert to normal form and solve for a mixed
strategy equilibrium, and then convert back to a behav strategy, the
resulting strategy is not even a behav strategy.  Probs add to more
than one on last infoset for player 1.  The problem is that the mixed
nash equilibrium for the normal form game has no realization
equivalent behavior strategy.  What should happen is that a warning
should be issued that since the game is not perfect recall, it is not
be possible to convert themixed to an equivalent behav.

//------------------------------

Bug D34: Zoom window focus problem

When the focus is in the zoom window, the arrow keys do not move the
cursor around the tree.  Same problem for the Inspect Cursor window. 

//------------------------------

Bug D35: Editing a normal form does not invalidate solutions.  

It should invalidate all solutions when you make any changes to the
normal form.

-------------  older bugs that still remain ---------------

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.2

> 2. Why the solution list window does not vanish from the upper right
> close button?

RDM: Problem still exists (9/3/98).  Also, the Label->Strats dialog
box (and perhaps others as well) can not be gotten rid of in any way,
even after the main Gambit window has been dismissed (on Linux).
N.B. the "close" button here refers to the window manager close button.

RDM: 12/27/98 This bug is now fixed for most windows, but there are
still a few with the problem -- especially in the elimdom menu.

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.4,  Scrolling problems

> 4. When the main window for the tree design is not maximized the
> vertical and the horizontal bars are getting out of the screen.

RDM: Problem still exists 9/3/98.  Here are furhter details:

Scrolling is not correct: Eg(this is all on Linux): Load caro2.efg.
Hit +magnify button twice.  Move cursor R,R,D,R,R.  Notice how screen
does not always display cursor.  Now hit L,L,L,L, and try to get back
to the root node.  Again cursor moves off the screen, and the bottom
scroll bar does not help to move the window to display the cursor.

Also, the scroll bars require a complete redraw before the next scroll
bar hit is recorded. Load a big game like bayes2a.efg, andthen hit the
right scroll bar three times insuccession to try and scroll the screen
down.  It redraws the screen three times instead of halting the redraw
when the second and third hits to the scroll bar are made.  Also,
dragging the scroll bar does not work.  This makes it very time
consuming to move around a large gaem.


//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.6

> 6. In the edit behav Solution window the ? button seems to do nothing.

RDM: 9/3/98 On Linux, it gives the same problem as above, "wxWindows: could
not execute wxhelp"

[ This is not a bug.  The wxhelp program must be in the path and the
WXHELPFILES environment variable must be set to point to the directory
where the help files live. ]

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.7

> 7. In the magnify mode the lines representing information sets are
> broken or lost on trees with big verical dimension ( due to many
> branches emanating from a single node). Also in this case horizontal
> gray lines appear and payoffs seems like double-stroked.

RDM: 9/3/98 This is still a problem.  Look at Bayes2a, try and
remember what the game is supposed to look like (or bring up two
copies, one for comparison). Then hit +Magnify three times.  Now move
around the tree with the cursor, and eventually you will see this.

RDM: Still a problem.  This may be related to similar problems in EF
GUI (See above GUI Bugs 5.4 and 5.7)

GUI Bug 7.4

RDM.  On Linux, Now the first level menus seem to be controlled by the
Alt-letter key, but then the subsequent ones just require the letters.
That seems fine to me.


//------------------------------

GUI Bug 7.5

> 5. The button at the top right of the screen (to minimize etc.) don't

RDM: Still a problem -- eg on solution display window (Hit Inspect ->
solution after solving a game, and then try and get rid of it with the
close button -- top right button on Linux)

GUI Bug 8.1-8.2: XView, Transient bugs

I was not able to reproduce this.  I am assumintg this is under XView?

Your subsequent message indicates this is a transient problem of some
sort.  Let me know if there is any pattern to when it occurs.  

RDM: This looks like system stuff at his end to me.  We can't check it
out until we compile an XView version of new code.

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 9:  Bad postscript files.  

On Tue, 23 Jun 1998, Bernhard von Stengel wrote:

Hi,

more apparent bugs. This time:  buggy generation of PS-Files.
This may be a bug in the wxwin package.

1.
When I generate large games, display fails altogether since
the scaling doesn't work.  I only see the initial part of a very
large tree.

2.
In some cases, parts of the tree are also DELETED when the PS
file is generated.  I presume this is due to faulty memory management,
but it can also be a GAMBIT bug.  It occasionally happened for smaller
games, but then it disappeared when the file was reloaded, so I could
reproduce it only for the large extensive form game.
To document this, I enclose by separate mail

a. The (level 8) generated tree which looks complete as a file.

b. The PS file generated from the GUI interface.

   In order to look at the PS file, I found a method to print it easily
   on an ordinary printer.  Namely, I enclose in this mail a latex
   file that assumes that the GUI-generated file is stored as

   efg.eps

   in the same directory.  Running it through latex, it then generates a
   single page where the game tree fits on a letter-size page, filling it
   maximally. The .dvi file has to be converted to .ps with  dvips,
   of course.  I found LATEX the easiest way to do this.

Regards, Bernhard

This is a Gambit BUG.  Or at least, I get the same problem running under
xview. It appears to be that the scroll is not working correctly under
XView. You can view the game in the zoom window (in prefs menu), but that
only shows the part near the cursor.  

Perhaps this is a problem in wxwin support of xview, as there is no
problem viewing the game under the motif version or the Windows version of
the GUI.

RDM: I reproduced this under version .94 on Xview.  we need to compile
the new code under Xview to see if this still exists.

GUI Bugs:

//------------------------------

Bug D3: Bugs in Outcome interface

For the extensive form, the outcome window does not stay on top when you
select nodes while attaching outcomes to the game.

For the normal form, there are two outcome windows, one accessed by
Edit->Outcomes, and the other by double click (Ctrl click on Linux).
Why are there two different interfaces?  We should ditch the Ctrl-click
editing dialog and simply have it bring up the Edit->Outcomes dialog.

//------------------------------

Bug D4:  Cannot get GUI Help on Unix systems

When you hit Help->Contents menu item, it says 

  66 mill:/home/mill/rdm/gambit wxhelp: command not found
  wxWindows: could not execute 'wxhelp'
  wxhelp: command not found

at the unix prompt, then hangs for 45 seconds until it displays a
window saying that the help file cannot be found.

NOTE: This is almost certainly due to the lack of the "wxhelp" program in
the user's path.  Also, the WXHELPFILES environment variable has to point
to a directory where the help files live.

NOTE2: There is a wxhelp2 program which can run HTML files.  This
needs to be compiled for Linux and tested on the gambit HTML files
(in hss: ~gambit/public_html/guiman).  We also need to decide which
help formats we will be supporting on Unix and Windows.

//------------------------------

Bug D5: Saving files

When saving a file in the GUI, it should remember the current
name of the file, and use the same name when saving the file. 

When overwriting an existing file, the GUI should always prompt
for a new label.

There are other instances of the File Selector dialog that should 
also be looked at to make sure they behave as expected.

//------------------------------

Bug D7:  Conflict with Netscape

When running the GUI, if netscape is already running, you may or may not
get the following message, (or something like it, depending on the
machine):

   X Error of failed request:  BadDrawable (invalid Pixmap or Window parameter)
   Major opcode of failed request:  55 (X_CreateGC)
   Resource id in failed request:  0x0
   Serial number of failed request:  379
   Current serial number in output stream:  391

We should either fix this, or deliver a more informative error messsage.
It is unlikely that it can be fixed because it's a known problem with 
wxWindows, but it can be avoided by running netscape with a private colormap
using "netscape -install".  Uncaught exceptions should bring up a dialog
which suggests doing this (this is lame, but better than nothing).

//------------------------------

Bug D8:  LiapSolve does not keep partial solutions.  

When solving an extensive form game (try using the standard solution
setting of All Nash on e01.efg -- which puts you in an infinite loop
in liap solve), the code returns empty solutions when it is terminated
with the Cancel button.  This appears to be a problem in the subgame
soving code which appeared when we changed to exceptions for handling
the cancel event.  Here is some relevant correspondence

We have an additional parameter in the gui (seems like it should be in the
GCL also, but I don't see it there) which sets the maximum number of
solutions per subgame.  I thought this was supposed to solve this problem
by effectively putting the infinite loop at the top.  I thought this
should deal with the first problem too (games with no proper subgames.) 
But I will have to look at the code to see what this actually does. 
Perhaps it is not implemented correctly. 


//------------------------------

Bug D9: Need color coding of payoffs in outcome window

The outcome editing window should color-code the payoffs for
each player in the same way that they're displayed in the nfg 
and efg displays.


//------------------------------

Bug D10: Drag and drop of outcomes don't always work in NFG

When there are so many outcomes that you have to scroll to select
the desired one, dragging and dropping of the outcome doesn't work.
E.g. try 8x8.nfg.


//------------------------------

Bug D11: guiman.tex needs to be updated and recompiled.

We get TeX errors when running latex on this file.


//------------------------------

Bug D12: Does Windows help support HTML?

This isn't a bug, but since wxhelp2 supports html it would be convenient
to use HTML for all our help files.  If Windows help supports HTML this
would be much easier.


//------------------------------

Bug D13: Interrupting solution causes cursor to remain a watch.

Actually, even if the solution This is self-explanatory.

//------------------------------

Bug D14:  windows for text entries are not wide enough.  

On Linux, load an extensive form game, and go to

  Solve->Custom->ExtensiveForm->QRE.

The fields for entry of the PXI file and PXI command are much too narrow.  

//------------------------------

Bug D15:  Won't accept file name abbreviations

In fields requiring file names, the GUI will not accept the "~"
character or aliases.  For example, running QRE on poker.efg, the
following errors result, even though both
'~rdm/gambit/pxi/pxi_motif_Linux' and and 'newpxi' refer to valid
executable files, and run fine when entered from the command line.
 
  wxWindows: could not execute '~rdm/gambit/pxi/pxi_motif_Linux'
  wxWindows: could not execute 'newpxi'

//------------------------------

Bug D16:  Stray files appear.  

After running the GUI, empty files called 'gout' or gerr' will appear
in the executable directory. This happens, for example after loading
poker.efg, and doing Solve->Custom->ExtensiveForm->Qre->OK, and then
closing the gui.

//------------------------------

Bug D17:  Need "in place" editing of outcomes for large games.  

This is really more of an enhancement than a bug.  

In the normal and extensive form, if the game is large, it takes a
long time to bring up the outcome window, and find the outcome
associated with a given location in the EF/NF game.  We should
have "in place" editing, where you can edit the outcome right on the
normal or extensive form dislpay.





-------------  older bugs that still remain ---------------

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.2

> 2. Why the solution list window does not vanish from the upper right
> close button?

RDM: Problem still exists (9/3/98).  Also, the Label->Strats dialog
box (and perhaps others as well) can not be gotten rid of in any way,
even after the main Gambit window has been dismissed (on Linux).

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.4,  Scrolling problems

> 4. When the main window for the tree design is not maximized the
> vertical and the horizontal bars are getting out of the screen.

RDM: Problem still exists 9/3/98.  Here are furhter details:

Scrolling is not correct: Eg(this is all on Linux): Load caro2.efg.
Hit +magnify button twice.  Move cursor R,R,D,R,R.  Notice how screen
does not always display cursor.  Now hit L,L,L,L, and try to get back
to the root node.  Again cursor moves off the screen, and the bottom
scroll bar does not help to move the window to display the cursor.

Also, the scroll bars require a complete redraw before the next scroll
bar hit is recorded. Load a big game like bayes2a.efg, andthen hit the
right scroll bar three times insuccession to try and scroll the screen
down.  It redraws the screen three times instead of halting the redraw
when the second and third hits to the scroll bar are made.  Also,
dragging the scroll bar does not work.  This makes it very time
consuming to move around a large gaem.


//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.6

> 6. In the edit behav Solution window the ? button seems to do nothing.

RDM: 9/3/98 On Linux, it gives the same problem as above, "wxWindows: could
not execute wxhelp"

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 5.7

> 7. In the magnify mode the lines representing information sets are
> broken or lost on trees with big verical dimension ( due to many
> branches emanating from a single node). Also in this case horizontal
> gray lines appear and payoffs seems like double-stroked.

RDM: 9/3/98 This is still a problem.  Look at Bayes2a, try and
remember what the game is supposed to look like (or bring up two
copies, one for comparison). Then hit +Magnify three times.  Now move
around the tree with the cursor, and eventually you will see this.

RDM: Still a problem.  This may be related to similar problems in EF
GUI (See above GUI Bugs 5.4 and 5.7)

RDM: Still a problem (9/3/98)

//------------------------------

GUI Bug 7.4

RDM: Seems fixed to me (9/3/98, on Linux)

>

RDM.  On Linux, Now the first level menus seem to be controlled by the
Alt-letter key, but then the subsequent ones just require the letters.
That seems fine to me.


//------------------------------

GUI Bug 7.5

> 5. The button at the top right of the screen (to minimize etc.) don't

RDM: Still a problem -- eg on solution display window (Hit Inspect ->
solution after solving a game, and then try and get rid of it with the
close button -- top right button on Linux)

RDM: Let's not worry about this one, except to give a general warning
in he documentation that there may be conflicts with other programs.

GUI Bug 8.1-8.2: XView, Transient bugs

I was not able to reproduce this.  I am assumintg this is under XView?

Your subsequent message indicates this is a transient problem of some
sort.  Let me know if there is any pattern to when it occurs.  

RDM: This looks like system stuff at his end to me.  We can't check it
out until we compile an XView version of new code.

GUI Bug 9:  Bad postscript files.  

On Tue, 23 Jun 1998, Bernhard von Stengel wrote:

Hi,

more apparent bugs. This time:  buggy generation of PS-Files.
This may be a bug in the wxwin package.

1.
When I generate large games, display fails altogether since
the scaling doesn't work.  I only see the initial part of a very
large tree.

2.
In some cases, parts of the tree are also DELETED when the PS
file is generated.  I presume this is due to faulty memory management,
but it can also be a GAMBIT bug.  It occasionally happened for smaller
games, but then it disappeared when the file was reloaded, so I could
reproduce it only for the large extensive form game.
To document this, I enclose by separate mail

a. The (level 8) generated tree which looks complete as a file.

b. The PS file generated from the GUI interface.

   In order to look at the PS file, I found a method to print it easily
   on an ordinary printer.  Namely, I enclose in this mail a latex
   file that assumes that the GUI-generated file is stored as

   efg.eps

   in the same directory.  Running it through latex, it then generates a
   single page where the game tree fits on a letter-size page, filling it
   maximally. The .dvi file has to be converted to .ps with  dvips,
   of course.  I found LATEX the easiest way to do this.

Regards, Bernhard

GUI Bug 10.2:  Problem under XView

This is a Gambit BUG.  Or at least, I get the same problem running under
xview. It appears to be that the scroll is not working correctly under
XView. You can view the game in the zoom window (in prefs menu), but that
only shows the part near the cursor.  

Perhaps this is a problem in wxwin support of xview, as there is no
problem viewing the game under the motif version or the Windows version of
the GUI.

RDM: I reproduced this under version .94 on Xview.  we need to compile
the new code under Xview to see if this still exists.

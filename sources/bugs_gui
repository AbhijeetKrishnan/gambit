Bug D3: Bugs in Outcome interface

When filling in payoffs for outcomes in the extensive form outcome
display on Linux, there is no echoing of keystrokes.  So you can't
tell what you are entering.  Also, when entering outcome names, stray
numbers are prefixed to the name, and you can't get rid of
them. Finally,the outcome window does not stay on top when you attach
outcomes to the game.

For the normal form, there are two outcome windows, one accessed by
Solve->Outcomes, and the other by double click (ctrl click on Linux).
Why are there two different interfaces. We should improve the editing
capabilities in the first interface, and ditch the other.  Note that
right now, the editing on the normal form outcomes (in the first
interface) suffers from the same problems as in extensive form.  

Finally, in the normal form outcome window, I was unable to switch the
setting to the long format using the Solve
Outcomes->Opt->Long/CompactFormat setting.

I had solve mode set to "standard" and had the following boxes checked
under "Opt": Update dynamically, save default, equ value and Nash.

Attached is the file generating the error.  Specifically, I was able to
get it to solve correctly on the first try, then I changed the payoof
for player 1 in cell 3,4 from 1 to zero (or vice-versa).  I re-ran solve
and generated the error.

NFG 1 D "" { "1" "2" }

{ { "1" "2" "3" "4" }
{ "1" "2" "3" "4" }
}

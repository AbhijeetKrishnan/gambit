<H2>GAMBIT GUI</H2>
<P>
The Gambit GUI consists of two self-contained modules for
representing, displaying and manipulating games.  A game can be viewed
in either the extensive or normal forms.  Although independent, the
modules are integrated and it is possible to solve the game
in the normal form while viewing it in the extensive.  It is also
possible to go from the extensive form representation to the normal
form (but not vice versa at the present).  <P>
When you first launch the gambit GUI, you will see a screen as in
Figure 4.1<P>

You can select the module to be used in the File menu,
in one of two ways:<P>
<UL>

<LI> Build a new game by selecting <B>File-&gt;New</B> , and then
choosing either Extensive or Normal.  The toolbar can be used to speed
up frequently used commands.
<LI> Load an existing game by selecting <B>File-&gt;Open</B>, and then
selecting a file that contains a previously saved game in either
extensive or normal form.
</UL>

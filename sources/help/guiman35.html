<H3>Creating and Editing Supports</H3>
<P>
This dialog is used to create a new support or edit an existing
support.  It is accessed through the <B>Supports-&gt;New</B> or <B>
Supports-&gt;Edit</B> menu item.  Only the normal form version is shown, as
the functionality for the extensive form is similar.<P>

<P>
The hilighted strategies are those that are included in the support.
A new support starts with the default of the <EM>full support</EM>,
editing a support starts with the selected support as the default.  To
deselect a player's strategy, click on it in the appropriate listbox.
The strategy will no longer be hilighted.  When the dialog is
dismissed, the newly created support will be added to the support
list.<P>

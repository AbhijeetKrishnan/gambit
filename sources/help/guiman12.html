<H3>Wildcard notation</H3>

To represent a collection of strategies which differ only in the choice at
a particular information set, we use a "wildcard'' 
notation.  For example,
if a player has three choices at its second information set, then the 
notation <TT>3*2</TT> is used to represent the collection of strategies, 
<TT>{312, 322, 332}</TT>.  <P>
The <TT>*</TT> notation in GAMBIT serves the same purpose as the "wildcard'' 
character in DOS file specifications.  To get a good appreciation for how 
the wildcard works, you should exit GAMBIT and WINDOWS, go to the root 
directory of your hard drive, and type <TT>del *.*[RET]</TT>.<P>

<H3>Edit Menu (efg)</H3>

This menu item is used to build or modify the extensive form game.
This section assumes a working knowledge of the conventions used in
the GAMBIT extensive form display (discussed in the <A HREF="guiman8.html#extformsec">Extensive
Form</A> section).  Note that any structural changes to the
tree structure will invalidate all existing solutions.  The solutions
list will be cleared and solutions removed.<P>
The <B>Edit</B> menu may also be called up by clicking the <EM>right</EM>
mouse button causing the menu to pop up at the current mouse cursor
position.<P>

In addition, many of the operations in this menu can be implemented by 
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">drag and drop</A> operations, as indicated in the
descriptions below.  <P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Node:
<DD>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Add Move:
<DD> The selected node is put into an information set
using the <A HREF="guiman36.html#AddMove">Add Move</A> dialog.  The result is that the
node becomes a decision node, with number of branches equal to the
number of actions in the information set.  New child nodes are created
as successor nodes to the actions in the information set.  Only valid
at terminal nodes.  

</TD>
<DT> Delete Move:
<DD> Deletes the move at the cursor node from the
extensive form game.  The subtree rooted at one of the actions takes
the place of the deleted node in the tree.  You will be prompted to
select a branch to keep.  All other subtrees descending from the
cursor node are deleted.  Deleting a move does not delete
the information set which the corresponding node was in.

</TD>
<DT> Insert Move:
<DD> This is analogous to <A HREF="guiman36.html#AddMove">Add Move</A>,
except that it can be used at a non terminal node.  The move is
inserted into the tree at that point, and the portion of the tree that
was previously at that node is moved to the first child of the
inserted node.

</TD>
<DT> Label:
<DD> Each node can have a label associated with it.  This
function allows the entering or modification of this label.  The
display of these labels is controlled in the 
<A HREF="guiman37.html#Legends">Legends</A> Dialog.

</TD>
<DT> Set Mark:
<DD> The GUI allows you to mark (memorize) one node for
later use.  The marked node is required in some tree operations.  The
marked node is indicated by a small circular token on the game tree.
Note that drag-and-drop mouse operations make the node-mark
unnecessary.

</TD>
<DT> Goto Mark:
<DD>  Moves the cursor to the mark.  This can be useful in a 
very large game to quickly move from one part of the game to another. 
</DL>


</TD>
<DT> Actions:
<DD>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Delete:
<DD> Select the action to be deleted from the dialog box.
The selected action will be removed from all information sets that it
belongs to.  All descendants of the nodes at this branches are also
removed.<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> Place the cursor on top of a
branch corresponding to the action to be deleted while pressing the
shift key.  The cursor will change to a scissors token.  Pressing the
mouse button while the scissors are displayed will delete the action
from the tree.

</TD>
<DT> Insert:
<DD> A new action is inserted after the action that is
selected from the dialog box.  A branch will be added to every node
that belongs to the same information set as the selected node.<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> Place the cursor at the juncture
of the branch lines with the end of the node line (the point where the
action branches begin).  Press the mouse button and drag it to the
right.  A new branch will appear as a "rubber band," which you can
drag to a location where you want the new action to appear.

</TD>
<DT> Append:
<DD> Appends a new action as the last action at the selected
information set.

</TD>
<DT> Label:
<DD> Each action in an infoset can have a label.  This allows
the setting or changing of this label.

</TD>
<DT> Probabilities:
<DD> Allows the explicit setting of each action
probability.  Only valid when the cursor is on a CHANCE node.
</DL>
<P>

</TD>
<DT> Infoset:
<DD>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Merge:
<DD> Merges the information set at the cursor into the
information set at the mark.  Both information sets must have the same
number of actions.  Note that you can not merge infosets across
different subgames (unmark subgames first).<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> The merge operation can be
achieved by clicking on an infoset marker (small circle) at the base
of a node and dragging it to the infoset marker of the target node.

</TD>
<DT> Break:
<DD> Removes the node at the cursor from its information set,
creating a new information set with just that node in it.

</TD>
<DT> Split:
<DD> Splits the information set with all of the nodes above the
cursor node remaining in the same infoset, while all of the nodes
below the cursor node are moved to a newly created infoset.<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> The split operation can be
achieved by moving the mouse cursor on top of the line connecting the
nodes in the infoset while holding down the <TT>Shift</TT> key.  When the
mouse cursor is on top of the infoset line, it will change to
'scissors.'  Pressing the mouse button while the cursor is 'scissors'
will split the infoset.

</TD>
<DT> Join:
<DD> Removes the node at the cursor from its information set,
and puts it into the information set at the mark.

</TD>
<DT> Label:
<DD> Assigns a textual name to the information set.  These
names can be displayed on the extensive form display by appropriate
selection in the  (REF NOT FOUND) section. 

</TD>
<DT> Player:
<DD> This allows changing the player that has the choice at
this node.  You can choose any player except the one that is currently
selected.  If player names are being displayed on the tree, double
clicking on the name will also activate this operation.

</TD>
<DT> Reveal:
<DD> Reveals the information set to selected players.  This
will result in refining the information partitions of players to which
the information set is revealed in such a way that they observe all
actions at the information set.
</DL>
<P>

</TD>
<DT> Outcomes:
<DD> Create, edit and delete outcomes
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> New:
<DD> Creates a new outcome for the game, and brings up the 
<A HREF="guiman28.html#ChangePayoff">Change Payoff</A> dialog to edit the payoffs for
the outcome.  Note that outcomes need not be attached to any node.
Use the <B>attach</B> item in this sub menu to attach the outcome to a
cell in the game. 

</TD>
<DT> Delete:
<DD> Deletes the selected outcome.  The outcome will be also
detached from any nodes in the extensive form game to which it was
attached. The <A HREF="guiman29.html#SelectOutcome">Select Outcome</A> dialog is used
to select the outcome to delete.

</TD>
<DT> Attach:
<DD> Brings up the <A HREF="guiman29.html#SelectOutcome">Select Outcome</A> 
dialog to select an outcome to attach to the selected node of the
extensive form.

</TD>
<DT> Detach:
<DD> Detaches the outcome from the selected node, resulting
in no outcome attached to the node.

</TD>
<DT> Label:
<DD> Assign a label or name to the outcome attached to
selected node.

</TD>
<DT> Payoffs:
<DD> Edit the payoffs of the outcome attached to the
selected node of the extensive form. The <A HREF="guiman28.html#ChangePayoff">Change 
Payoff</A> dialog is used to edit the payoffs. If there is
no outcome attached, then a new outcome is created and attached to the
node.
</DL>
<P>

</TD>
<DT> Tree:
<DD>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Copy
<DD> Copies the part of the tree following the mark to the
position of the cursor.  Note that the cursor must be at a terminal
node.  No new information sets are created by this operation.  Thus,
you may have to edit the information sets after this operation to
achieve the desired change.<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> The copy function can be
achieved by clicking on and dragging the source node to the target
node while holding down the <B>Control</B> key.  The cursor will change
to a small 'tree' icon with the word 'copy' to indicate that a copy
operation is in progress.  Releasing the mouse while the cursor is not
on any terminal node will cancel the operation.

</TD>
<DT> Move
<DD> Moves the part of the game tree following the mark to the
position of the cursor.<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> The move function can be
achieved by clicking on and dragging the source node to the target
node. The cursor will change to a small 'tree' icon with the word
'move' to indicate that a move operation is in progress.  Releasing
the mouse while the cursor is not on any terminal node will cancel the
operation.

</TD>
<DT> Delete
<DD> The node at the cursor and all its descendants will be
deleted.<P>
<A HREF="guiman58.html#DragAndDrop">Drag-And-Drop:</A> The Delete Tree function can be
achieved by placing the cursor on the node line for the sub tree that
you want to delete, while pressing the shift key.  The cursor will
change to a scissors token.  Pressing the mouse button while the
scissors are displayed will delete the node and all its descendants
from the tree.

</TD>
<DT> Label
<DD> The label pertains to the game as a whole and will be
displayed on the titlebar of the window.

</TD>
<DT> Players
<DD> Each player must have a name.  Although not required,
it is highly recommended that these names be unique.  When a player is
first created, it is given a default name "Player #."  This dialog
allows you to change these default names to something appropriate to
the game.

</TD>
<DT> Infoset
<DD> This dialog allows you to change the names of
information sets, remove empty information sets, and create new
information sets.

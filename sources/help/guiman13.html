<H3>Normal Form</H3>

The normal form of a game is a mapping which associates with 
each <A HREF="guiman113.html#stratprofgloss">strategy profile</A> a vector of
 payoffs for the players.  The normal form will thus be an n dimensional 
matrix, with each cell containing a vector of length n.<P>
Every extensive form game has an associated normal form.  The payoff for 
a given player under a particular strategy is computed as the sum of the 
<A HREF="guiman110.html#realprobgloss">realization probabilities</A> of each node times the 
value to the player of any outcome at that node.  The payoffs in the normal 
form are simply the expected payoff to each player from the given strategy
 profile.  <P>

  Simple Two Player Poker Game
<P>
Figure 3.3 gives the normal form for the extensive form game 
of poker illustrated in 
<A HREF="guiman8.html#extformsec">Figure 3.1</A>. <P>
In the game of  <A HREF="guiman8.html#extformsec">Figure 3.1</A>, with the 
strategy profile <TT>(12, 1)</TT>, the realization probability of the terminal 
node on the path RED, RAISE, MEET, with a payoff of ($2.00, -$2.00) 
is 1/2, and the realization probability of terminal node on the path 
BLACK, FOLD, with a payoff of  (-$1.00, $1.00) is 1/2.    All other 
terminal nodes have realization probability of 0 at this strategy profile.  
Taking expected values, this gives a payoff of  
($0.50, -$0.50), which is the entry in the normal form for this cell.  <P>

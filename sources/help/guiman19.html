<H2>Data Types</H2>

Gambit can do computations in either floating point (float) or
exact arithmetic (rational).  Each number in the extensive an extensive 
or normal form game has an internal representation, or "precision'' which is 
either floating point or rational.  <P>

<DT> Float:
<DD> Floating point numbers are represented internally as
double precision floating point numbers, which on most machines
results in about 15 digits of accuracy.  The benefit of floating point
calculations is speed, since floating point numbers are designed to
fit in a fixed amount of storage, and arithmetic operations are coded
in hardware.  However, in some games, floating point calculations can
result in cumulation of roundoff errors that will lead to either
incorrect solutions or failure to find solutions that exist.

</TD>
<DT> Rational:
<DD> Rational numbers are represented internally as the
quotient of two arbitrary precision integers.  Doing calculations in
rationals will guarantee that the answer is exact for those algorithms
that support rational calculations.  However calculations in rationals
are slower than floating point calculations by one or two orders of
magnitude.  Currently the only algorithms supporting calculations in
rationals are the following two person algorithms: LpSolve, LcpSolve,
and EnumPure and EnumMixed.

<P>
The precision of a number is indicated in output by the way it is
printed.  If the number contains a decimal point, then its internal
representation is floating point.  If it has a <TT>/</TT> or is written
as an integer (with no decimal or <TT>/</TT>), then it is a rational.
Similarly, when you enter a number, the internal representation is
determined by the way it is entered.<P>
The data for a game can be a mixture of floating point and rational
numbers.  Any preliminary calculations in Gambit (such as elimination
of dominated strategies, conversion to normal form) are done in the
best precision that is supported by the data of the game.  For example
if a calculation involves a floating point and rational number, the
result will be floating point.<P>
Some of the algorithms in Gambit support either floating point or
rational precision. The data for the game will be converted to that
precision, and the resulting solutions returned in that precision.  In
some cases, conversion from rational to floating point can lose
precision.  For example, the number 1/3 does not have an exact
representation in floating point.  Thus, in cases where exact
solutions are required, it is good advice to enter all data in
rational precision.<P>

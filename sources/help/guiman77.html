<H3>Nash Equilibrium</H3>

Every finite game has at least one <A HREF="guiman105.html#nashequigloss">Nash 
equilibrium</A> in either pure or mixed strategies
([5]).<P>
Gambit has a number of algorithms to find Nash equilibria.  The
appropriate algorithm to use depends on a number of factors, most
importantly, the number of players in the game, and the number of
equilibria you want to find.  For a detailed discussion of these
issues, see [6].<P>
Before computing equilibria, you may wish to <A HREF="guiman34.html#UnDominated">eliminate
dominated strategies</A> from the support.  The smaller the
support, the faster any algorithm will run.  However, dominance
elimination can itself be computationally intensive, especially if
mixed domination is used, or if dominance elimination is done on the
extensive form.<P>
<UL>

<LI> 
If you want to find more than one, or all Nash equilibria of a game,
then you may first successively eliminate strongly dominated
strategies.  Any equilibrium of the original game will also be an
equilibrium of the reduced game.
<LI> 
If you just want to find <EM>one</EM> Nash equilibrium, you can first
successively eliminate <EM>weakly</EM> dominated strategies.  Elimination
of weakly dominated strategies may eliminate some Nash equilibria of
the original game (so it should not be used if you want to find
multiple Nash equilibria,) but any Nash equilibrium to the reduced
game will be an equilibrium to the original game, so it can be used if
you only want to find one equilibrium .

<A HREF="guiman78.html#purenashsec"><B>Pure Equilibria</B></A><BR>

The <A HREF="guiman85.html#EnumPure">EnumPure</A> algorithm can be used to enumerate
all of the pure strategy equilibria for both extensive and normal form
games.  select EnumPure, and check <EM>Use NF</EM>.  This will find all pure
strategy Nash equilibria of the associated reduced normal form of the
game, and convert them to behavior strategies.<P>

<A HREF="guiman79.html#csumsec"><B>Two Person Constant Sum Games</B></A><BR>

For two person constant sum normal form games, the minimax theorem
applies.  The set of Nash equilibria is a convex set, and the problem
of finding Nash equilibria can be formulated as a linear program.  The 
<A HREF="guiman90.html#Lp">Lp algorithm</A> will solve a constant sum game using this
approach.<P>

<A HREF="guiman80.html#twopersec"><B>Two Person Games</B></A><BR>

For two person nonzero sum games, the problem of finding Nash
equilibria can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem, and
exact solutions can be found as long as computations are done in
rationals.  The <A HREF="guiman88.html#Lcp">Lcp algorithm</A> solves a two person game
using this approach.  Note that the Lcp algorithm can also be used
directly on an extensive form game, where it implements the Koller,
Megiddo, von Stengel Sequence form [7].  To find <EM>
one</EM> Nash equilibrium use Lcp with nEquilib set to 1.<P>
For a two person game the <A HREF="guiman84.html#EnumMixed">EnumMixed algorithm</A> 
will enumerate all of the extreme points of the components of the set
of Nash equilibria, and hence can be used to find <EM>all</EM> Nash
equilibria.  Using EnumMixed with nEquilib set to 0 will find all Nash
equilibria.  To find if there is more than one Nash equilibrium use
EnumMixed with nEquilib set to 2.<P>

<A HREF="guiman81.html#npernashsec"><B>N Person Games</B></A><BR>

For n-person normal form games, with n greater than two, the
<A HREF="guiman91.html#PolEnum">PolEnum</A> algorithm will find all Nash
equilibria. The PolEnum algorithm may be computationally infeasible on
large games.  Thus other algorithms are also available for finding one
or a sample of Nash equilibria.  Since Nash equilibria can be
irrational, the algorithms to locate one equilibrium will only find
approximations (to machine accuracy) of Nash equilibria.<P>
The <A HREF="guiman92.html#SimpDiv">SimpDiv algorithm</A> is guaranteed to locate one
equilibrium for an n-person normal form game.  This algorithm can be
very slow on some games.  Hence two other algorithms are also
supported, <A HREF="guiman86.html#QRE">QRE</A> and <A HREF="guiman89.html#Liap">Liap</A>.  These
algorithms can also be used to search for multiple equilibria (with no
guarantee that all have been found,) and to search for equilibria
close to a given starting point.<P>

<H3>Games of incomplete information</H3>

Games of incomplete information are games in which different players have 
different beliefs about the underlying parameters (such as the utility 
functions, strategy sets, or number of players) of the game.  The standard 
way of treating such games is given in [3], where it
is shown that 
 such games are equivalent to games in which players have some common
prior distribution over the joint distribution of characteristics, and
 then individuals observe their own type, but not that of the other players 
in the game.  <P>
Games of incomplete information can be modeled in GAMBIT by having an
initial chance move determine the distribution of types, and then
defining information sets so each individual observes only their own
type.<P>

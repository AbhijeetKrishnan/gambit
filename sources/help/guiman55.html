In the extensive form, the game is represented as a topological tree.  The 
section on representation of the <A HREF="guiman8.html#extformsec">Extensive Form</A> 
has a more detailed explanation of this form.
Compared to the Normal Form, the Extensive Form interface is much richer
and thus considerably more complex.  A major portion of the functionality
is devoted to the tree building.  Another set of functions deals with
customizing the display, and yet another set of functions takes care of
the solutions and their display.  <P>

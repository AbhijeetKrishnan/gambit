<H2>Mathematical Errors</H2>

Under certain conditions some of the numerical algorithms may attempt to
execute an invalid mathematical operation.  Possible examples include
taking a logarithm of 0, attempting to exponentiate a very large number, and
other overflow or domain violation errors.  When this condition is detected,
the user is presented with an option to:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Continue
<DD> This is the default option.  The user acknowledges the
error and the algorithm continues.

</TD>
<DT> Ignore
<DD> The user acknowledges the error and all future errors
are ignored (no notification).

</TD>
<DT> Quit
<DD> The user instructs the program to terminate.
</DL>
<P>
Note that if either of the first two options is selected, the results 
returned by the algorithm may be invalid.<P>

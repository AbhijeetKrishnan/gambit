<H2>Subgame</H2>

A subgame is a subtree with the property that for every information 
set containing members in the subtree, all members of the information 
set are elements of the subtree.  In other words, every information set 
is either contained in or has empty intersection with the subtree. <P>
In Figure 3.1, there are no proper subtrees of the extensive
form, because every subtree except that starting at the Root node breaks
up Player 2's information set.<P>

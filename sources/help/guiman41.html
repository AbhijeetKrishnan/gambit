<H2>Normal Form Display</H2>
<P>
In the normal form representation, the game is viewed as a
2-dimensional window into an N-dimensional matrix.  Each 2D window
shows a table of payoffs for each player as a function of the
strategies for two of the players, holding the strategies of all of
the other players (if there are any) fixed.  Note that this
organization requires each game to have at least two players.  Each
cell contains the payoff vector with one entry per player for the
strategy profile determined by this cell.  The profile itself is set
by using a combination of settings for the row and column players plus
the strategy settings for the rest of the players.  <P>
The payoff vector can be edited by double-clicking on the cell and
entering new values in the dialog. To enter an entire game matrix, an
accelerator key may be useful.  Assuming the default accelerators are
used, pressing the <TT>TAB</TT> key will move the cursor to the next cell
of the normal form, and call up the payoff edit dialog. So an entire
matrix can be entered by first double clicking on the first (upper
left) cell, editing the entries (using tab to advance to successive
entries), hitting return, then successively pressing tab, editing the
entries and pressing return to enter the remaining cells of the
matirix.<P>

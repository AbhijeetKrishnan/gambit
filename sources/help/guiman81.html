<H3>N Person Games</H3>

For n-person normal form games, with n greater than two, the
<A HREF="guiman91.html#PolEnum">PolEnum</A> algorithm will find all Nash
equilibria. The PolEnum algorithm may be computationally infeasible on
large games.  Thus other algorithms are also available for finding one
or a sample of Nash equilibria.  Since Nash equilibria can be
irrational, the algorithms to locate one equilibrium will only find
approximations (to machine accuracy) of Nash equilibria.<P>
The <A HREF="guiman92.html#SimpDiv">SimpDiv algorithm</A> is guaranteed to locate one
equilibrium for an n-person normal form game.  This algorithm can be
very slow on some games.  Hence two other algorithms are also
supported, <A HREF="guiman86.html#QRE">QRE</A> and <A HREF="guiman89.html#Liap">Liap</A>.  These
algorithms can also be used to search for multiple equilibria (with no
guarantee that all have been found,) and to search for equilibria
close to a given starting point.<P>

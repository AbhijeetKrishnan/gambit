<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
Gambit is a library of computer programs, written
in <TT>C++</TT>, for building, analyzing, and solving n-person games, in
either extensive or normal form.<P>
The Gambit Graphics User Interface (Gambit <A HREF="guiman101.html#guigloss">GUI</A>) is an
interactive, menu driven program for accessing this library of programs.
The Gambit GUI allows for the interactive building and solving of
extensive and normal form games.  It consists of two separate modules, one
for extensive and the other for normal form games.   In each module, you
can build, save load and solve a game, and convert back and forth from one
form of game to the other.<P>
Despite it's ease of use, the Gambit GUI is not suitable for repetitive or
computer intensive  operations.  A separate program, the Gambit Command
Language (<A HREF="guiman102.html#gclgloss">GCL</A>) is designed to be used for such operations 
on games.  The
GCL is a program which allows access to the functionality of the gambit
library of programs through a high level programming language.  The
Gambit GUI and GCL  are compatible with each other, in the sense that they
each generate files that can be read by the other, and they call the same
underlying library of functions.<P>

<H3>Numbering</H3>

In order  to associate strategy profiles in the 
normal form with the corresponding behavioral strategies in the extensive 
form, (and vice versa) you will need to understand how the branches and 
information sets are numbered.  The numbering of branches and information 
sets in the extensive form  is used to number pure strategies in the normal form.  <P>
The numbering of the branches is always
from top to bottom.  Thus, the highest branch at any node is always branch
1, the next branch is branch 2, etc. An <A HREF="guiman96.html#actiongloss">action</A> consists of 
the set of branches in an information set with the same branch number.  <P>
In Gambit, each <A HREF="guiman104.html#infosetgloss">information set</A> has a unique 
information set ID, consisting of the player followed by the information 
set number.  Information sets for each player are numbered consecutively, 
in <A HREF="guiman103.html#indextravgloss">indexed traversal order</A>.  
The information set ID can be displayed at the decision nodes by selecting 
it in the <A HREF="guiman66.html#displaymenu">Prefs-&gt;Legend</A> menu.  <P>

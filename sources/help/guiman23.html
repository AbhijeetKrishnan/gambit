The probability data for each information set is displayed on a
separate line.  The <B>Iset</B> column gives the infoset ID in the form
of (player #,iset #).  The next cell contains a vector of
probabilities in which each entry corresponds to an action that can be
taken at that infoset.  If a player has more than one infoset,
additional lines are used.  This format is repeated for each player in
the game.<P>
The Extensive and Normal form Solution Inspect dialogs have many
features in common.  See the <A HREF="guiman21.html#SolutionInspect">Solution 
Inspect</A> for a description of these common features.<P>
A useful feature when navigating large extensive form games is <EM>
Hilight Infosets</EM>.  It is toggled on or off from the EF window <B>
Inspect-&gt;Infosets</B>.  When enabled, double clicking on an infoset in
the EF window will hilight the corresponding infoset in the Solution
inspect window.  Double clicking on an infoset (Iset column) in the
Solution inspection window will hilight the corresponding infoset in
the EF window.<P>
For extensive form games, an additional level of solution inspection
is provided by the Node Inspect window.  The window may be turned
on/off through the <B>Inspect-&gt;Info</B> menu. When enabled, a small
window displays solution information pertaining to the cursor node.
The window can be dismissed by turning the option off in the same
menu.<P>

<H2>Domination</H2>

A strategy s for player i 
<EM>weakly dominates</EM> strategy t if, in every contingency, s 
is at least as good as t, and there is some contingency in which it is 
better.  The strategy s <EM>strongly dominates</EM> t if it is 
strictly better than t for player i in every contingency.  <P>
In the poker example of <A HREF="guiman13.html#normformsec">Figure 3.1</A>, 
for player 1, strategy <TT>21</TT> is weakly dominated by strategy <TT>12</TT>, 
and strongly dominated by <TT>11</TT>. <P>

<H2>Realization Probability</H2>

With each strategy profile, there is associated, to each node in the 
extensive form, a realization probability.  This is the probability of
 reaching that node under the given strategy profile.  This probability is 
computed by finding the path from the root node to the given node, and then 
computing the product of the probabilities of selecting each branch along 
the path.  <P>
Note that all nodes, not just terminal nodes have realization probabilities
 attached to them.  The realization probability of the decision node at RED 
RAISE is 0.5.  The realization probability of the Root node is always 1.<P>

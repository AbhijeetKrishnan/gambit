<H2>Decision Node</H2>

A decision node is a node which has at least one node that follows it.  
Decision nodes represent points at which either a player or chance must 
make a decision.  The different choices are represented by branches.<P>
In Figure 3.1, there are a total of five decision nodes (including the chance node). 
 The number of the player who makes a choice at a node appears underneath the
node as the first number after the parenthesis.  On the graphics screen,
decision nodes are color coded, with each player represented by a
different color.<P>

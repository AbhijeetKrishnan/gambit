<H3>PolEnum</H3>

Solves for all totally mixed Nash equilibrium of the game on a given
support. The algorithm iterates through all sub-supports of the
initial support to find the full support equilibria on each
sub-support.  Supports with singular solutions are skipped by the
algorithm when determined to have singular solutions.<P>
On each sub-support, the algorithm starts with a cube containing the
space of possible solutions and proceeds recursively.  The recursion
step begins with a subcube.  The subcube is discarded if the cube is
irrelevant in the sense of lying outside the space of possible
solutions.  Otherwise a modified Newton's method is used to search for
a solution in the subcube.  In the event that such a solution is
found, Taylor's series information at the solution is used to inquire
whether the solution is necessarily the unique solution in the
subcube.  If Newton's method leaves the subcube before finding a
solution, Taylor's series information at the center is used to inquire
whether we can be sure that the subcube contains no solutions.  If
neither of these procedures resolves the issue, the subcube is
subdivided and this recursion is performed on each smaller subcube.

The following optional parameters may be used to modify the behavior
of the algorithm:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Stop After:
<DD> By default, all equilibria are found.  This
parameter may be used to specify a maximum number of equilibria to be
found.

</TD>
<DT> Singular Supps:
<DD> Returns a list of the supports which have
singular solutions. <B>Note:</B> This is currently not implemented in
the GUI, but is available in the GCL.

</TD>
<DT> recurse:
<DD> Determines whether to recurse to all sub supports.
Default is <B>True</B>.

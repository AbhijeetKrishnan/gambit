<H3>EFG Custom Solutions</H3>

Only a user familiar with the algorithms should use the custom
settings since the program makes no attempt to check for the validity
of some of the parameters.  For a detailed discussion of the 
<A HREF="guiman83.html#SolutionAlgorithms">algorithms</A> see the appropriate sections.<P>
A custom algorithm is selected in the <B>Solve-&gt;Custom</B> submenu.
The game can be solved either by algorithms that work directly on the
extensive form, or by conversion to the normal form, and solving with
algorithms on the normal form.  In the later case, a normal form
representation will be automatically created, the algorithm run and
the solutions converted back to behavioral strategy profiles.<P>
The sub menus <B>Solve-&gt;Custom-&gt;Extensive</B> and <B>
Solve-&gt;Custom-&gt;Normal</B> are used to access algorithms which work on the
extensive and normal forms respectively.  Not all algorithms are
applicable to all games (for example, Linear Programming and Linear
Complementarity algorithms can only be applied to two person games.)
Algorithms that are not applicable to the current game will be greyed
out in the menu.<P>
After selecting an algorithm, the Algorithm parameter dialog will
appear. Each solution is controlled by three groups of settings, which
appear on the dialog box for the algorithm in the following order:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Dominance elimination:
<DD> Prior to running the algorithm, dominated
strategies may be eliminated, thus speeding up the consequent
calculations.  For normal form algorithms, the domination is done on
the reduced normal form after converting the game to normal form.  For
extensive form algorithms, dominance elimination is done directly on
the extensive form (Note: dominance elimination on the extensive form
can be slower than on the reduced normal form since it grows in
complexity with the size of the agent normal form of the game.)<P>
The type of dominance elimination is controlled by radioboxes at the
top of the dialog box for the algorithm.  In the case of algorithms
that work on the normal form, the same options are available as is
described in the normal form algorithm section:
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Depth:
<DD> Determines whether and how much dominance elimination is
to be done.  <B>None</B> indicates no dominance elimination is to be
done, <B>Once</B> selects a single step of elimination, and <B>
Iterative</B> selects iterative elimination of dominated strategies.

</TD>
<DT> Type:
<DD> Determines whether to use weak or strong domination.

</TD>
<DT> Method:
<DD> Determines whether to eliminate strategies that are
dominated only by pure strategies or whether to also eliminate
strategies dominated by mixed strategies.  Elimination by pure
strategies is faster, but may not find all dominated strategies, as it
is possible that strategies that are not dominated by any pure
strategy may be dominated by a mixed strategy.  For algorithms that
work directly on the extensive form, the <B>Pure/Mixed</B> selection is
not available.<P>
</DL>
<P>

</TD>
<DT> Subgames:
<DD> <A HREF="guiman62.html#SubgamesMenu">Subgames</A> may be marked prior
to running any algorithm.  If subgames are marked, Gambit will apply
the selected algorithm to each subgame in reverse tree traversal
order.  All solutions at each subgame are used to generate
continuation values for the higher level subgames.  Marking subgames
before running an algorithm that computes Nash equilibria will insure
that all equilibria computed are subgame perfect Nash equilibria.<P>
If there are a lot of subgames, and each subgame produces multiple 
solutions, the total number of solutions can grow exponentially.  
To interactively select which solutions to the subgames to keep, toggle 
the <B>interactively select subgames</B> checkbox.  <P>

</TD>
<DT> Algorithm parameters
<DD> The remainder of the dialog box is devoted
to parameters specific to the algorithm. Refer to the algorithm
section for these parameters.<P>
</DL>
<P>
Note that some algorithms require a starting point.  Depending on the
options selected in the custom parameters dialog for these algorithms,
a starting point dialog may pop up before the algorithm is run.  The
default (centroid) is usually a good place to start.  Double clicking
on the first profile in the window and pressing <B>OK</B> will select
the default and allow the algorithm to continue.  Advanced users may
choose to use values obtained by solving the game using a different
algorithm as a starting point.<P>

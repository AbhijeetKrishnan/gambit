<P>
Select the player to be in control of the move by clicking on a player
in the Player choicebox.  The player can be either chance or an
existing player, or a "New Player."  If New Player is chosen, a new
player will be created and given a default name "Player #."  If this
node is to belong to an existing information set, choose the desired
infoset from the Infoset choicebox.  If a new information set is to be
created, just enter the number of branches desired.  If the node
created was a CHANCE node, you will be prompted for the
probabilities associated with each branch.<P>

<H2>Default Accelerator Keys</H2>

To speed up some of the more commonly used commands in the GUI, a set of 
<EM>accelerator keys</EM> may be defined.  Once defined, a combination of keys
can be used to activate most of the menus and buttons.  Accelerator key
definitions are accessed through the Prefs-&gt;Accels menu.  Accelerator key
definitions are saved in the main Gambit defaults file (gambit.ini).  Gambit
is distributed with the following keys defined.
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> TAB:
<DD> The TAB key is defined to be <B>EditNextPayoff</B> event, and 
can be used to rapidly enter or modify a normal form.  Pressing TAB
will automatically move the cursor to the next cell in the normal
form, and display a dialog box to edit the entries.  Thus the entire
game can be entered by repeatedly pressing TAB and entering the values
-- no mouse operations are required.

</TD>
<DT> RETURN:
<DD> The RETURN key is defined as teh <B>EditPayoff</B>
event.  Hitting RETURn will bring up a dialog box to enter or edit the
payoff of the outcome attached to the selected cell of the normal
form.

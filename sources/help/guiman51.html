<H2>Normal Form Solutions</H2>

A large number of different <A HREF="guiman83.html#SolutionAlgorithms">algorithms</A> 
are available for solving normal form games.  In order to cater to
experienced users familiar with the properties of individual
algorithms, many relevant parameters can be edited through a variety
of solution related dialog boxes.  To allow simpler access to the
basic features provided by the algorithms, a set of commonly used <EM>
standard</EM> solution types has been included with Gambit.  The user need
only determine the general features of the desired equilibria and
Gambit will take care of all the details.<P>
The standard solution settings are accessed via the <B>
Solve-&gt;Standard</B> menu, or pressing the

<A HREF="solvtool">Picture</A>


 button on the toolbar.<P>
If the current game was generated from an extensive form game, and if no
changes have been made to either game, there will exist a link between the
two forms.  In this case, the <EM>Extensive form</EM> checkbox will be
enabled.  Checking this box will cause all generated solutions (if
applicable to the solution type) to be converted back into behavior
profiles and projected back to the extensive form window.  The solutions
can then be examined in the extensive form display.<P>

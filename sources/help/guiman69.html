<H3>Extensive form Supports</H3>

The concept of an extensive form support is very similar to that of a
normal form support.  Instead of considering the entire game tree, a
subset of all the player actions is considered.  That is, at each
decision node the player may have a reduced number of choices from
that of the original tree (full support).  However, at least one
action must exist at each node.  Most of the extensive form solution
algorithms support, the notion of extensive form supports.<P>
An extensive form support can be generated in one of two ways--either by 
dominated strategy elimination or by explicit creation of a new support.  
To eliminate dominated strategies in an extensive form game, you use the 
<A HREF="guiman34.html#UnDominated">Support-&gt;UnDominated</A> menu item.  <P>
To create a support, use the <A HREF="guiman35.html#EditSupport">Edit Support</A> 
dialog, which is accessible via the <B>Supports-&gt;New</B> menu item.<P>

<H3>Dominance Elimination Dialog</H3>
<P>
This dialog is used to compute undominated strategies for a normal or
extensive form games, and return a new support consisting of
undominated strategies.  It is accessed via the <B>
Supports-&gt;UnDominated</B> menu item.<P>

The following parameters can be selected:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Eliminate Iteratively:
<DD> Select this checkbox to iteratively
eliminate dominated strategies. The result will be a nested sequence
of supports, with the last one consisting of strategies that are
undominated in the final support.

</TD>
<DT> Type:
<DD> You can select the type of domination to use: weak or
strong domination.  

</TD>
<DT> Method:
<DD> You can select whether to eliminate only strategies
that are dominated by a single (pure) strategy or by a combination of
some strategies (mixed).  Elimination by mixed strategies is only
available for normal form games.  For extensive form games this
choicebox will also allow selection of <B>Conditional</B> domination,
which means that dominance computations are done using payoffs that
are conditional on reaching the information set of the strategy,
rather than on the payoff at the root node.

</TD>
<DT> Precision:
<DD> This option is only available for mixed elimination,
and determines whether the resulting computations are done in Rational
or Floating point.  

</TD>
<DT> Players:
<DD> You may select which players to eliminate dominated
strategies for. The default is all players, meaning that dominated
strategies for each player are computed over the initial support, and
then eliminated simultaneously to create the new support.

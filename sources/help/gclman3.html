<H2>Function Reference, by Category</H2>
<P>
This section contains a list of functions organized by
category.  For a description of each function and its arguments,
refer to the following, alphabetically organized, section.  <P>
In the following list, functions preceded by a <TT>#</TT> are <I>user
defined functions</I> (UDFs) which are defined in the file
<TT>stdudfs.gcl</TT>.  All the remaining functions are <I>built-in
functions</I> (BIFs).  Among the built-in functions, a small subset,
those preceeded by a <TT>*</TT> are "special'' functions, which do not
necessarily follow all of the rules of GCL functions.  These functions
are also not documented by the GCL <TT>Help</TT> function.  <P>
In the GCL, we have tried to minimize the number of built-in functions
to include only those that are essential.  The idea is that any other
function can be built up as a user defined function from the built-in
functions.  As part of the GCL distribution, we provide a library of
useful user defined functions in the file <TT>stdudfs.gcl</TT>.  If the
line <TT>Include["stdudfs.gcl"]</TT> is in the <TT>gclini.gcl</TT> file,
then this file is loaded when the GCL is started.  The user can also
load their own set of user defined functions by adding a line
<TT>Include["myudfs.gcl"]</TT><P>
The reason for minimizing the number of built-in funcitons is that it
allows for greater flexibility of use of the GCL, and minimizes
clogging up of the space of functions names.  It is much easier for
users to modify or redefine user defined functions to suit their
particular purpose than to modify built-in functions.  Also, this
approach makes it possible to run a "stripped down'' version of the
GCL if memory is a premium, by just not including unused user defined
functions.<P>
The cost to the above approach is that user defined functions can take
longer to execute than a corresponding built-in function with the same
functionality.<P>
Much of the development of the GCL is based on our own computational
experience, and tends to be optimized with respect to the kinds of
problems we encounter.  However, it may not be optimized
for the type of problems you find interesting.  If you find that
certain operations in the GCL are unacceptably slow, we would
appreciate getting feedback on this.<P>

<P>
To facilitate work with a large number of solutions, Gambit implements
solution sorting and filtering.  These features are accessed by the
<B>Sort/Filter</B> button in the solution inspect window.  Clicking an
item in the <B>Sort By</B> box will sort the solutions by their values
on that item.  [Double clicking on the column heading in the first row
of the Solution Inspect window will also sort the solutions by the
corresponding column].  Deselecting an item in the <B>Filter By</B> box
will cause the solutions that satisfy that item not to be displayed.
(I.e. to filter out all NASH equilibria, deselect the <B>Yes</B> item
in the <B>Nash</B> listbox; to display just solutions generated by the
<B>QRE</B> algorithm, deselect all items except for QRE in the <B>
Creator</B> listbox.  Note that the filter option may lead to some
confusion if newly generated solutions are automatically filtered out.<P>

This algorithm formulates and solves the game as a linear
complementarity problem.  For a normal form game, this algorithm
searches for equilibria of the specified normal form game using the
Lemke-Howson algorithm, as described in [11]. Eaves
[12] lexicographic rule for linear complementarity problems
is used to avoid cycling.<P>
In the Lemke Howson algorithm equilibria are found by following paths
of "almost'' equilibria, where one relaxes at most one constaint.
Equilibria are thus inter-connected by networks of paths that result
when different of the constraints are relaxed.  One can find the set
of "accessible'' equilibria in such methods by starting at the
extraneous solution and then tracing out this entire network.  See,
e. g., Shapley, [13].  However, the set of accessible
equilibria is not necessarily all Nash equilibria.<P>
For extensive form games, this algorithm implements Lemke's algorithm
on the "sequence form'' of the game, as defined by Koller, Megiddo
and von Stengel, in [7].<P>
<B>Limitations:</B> This algorithm is fast, but only works for two
person games.  [14] and [15] have
suggested ways in which the Lemke-Howson Algorithm can be extended to
general n-player games, but these extensions require methods of
tracing the solution to a set of non linear simultaneous equations,
and have not been implemented in GAMBIT.  Also, on some problems with
data type of Double, the current implementation can exhibit numerical
instability which in extreme cases can even lead to incorrect
solutions.  Solving the same problem with Rationals will resolve any
such difficulties.  However, the algorithm is much slower when
operating on Rationals than on Doubles.<P>
The following parameters can be specified:<P>
<DL>

<DT> Stop After:
<DD> Specifies the number of equilibria to find.  If not
specified, the default value is zero, which means that all equilibria
reachable by the algorithm (see above) are to be found.

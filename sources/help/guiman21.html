<H3>Solutions Inspect</H3>
<P>
The solution inspection dialog displays information about Mixed or
Behavior Profiles that are either returned by algorithms or entered by 
the user.  The dialogs for the <A HREF="guiman22.html#NormalSolutionInspect">Normal 
Form</A> and <A HREF="guiman23.html#ExtensiveSolutionInspect">Extensive 
Form</A> solutions have many features in common,
and hence are described together.<P>
The number of the solution that is currently selected will be
highlighted in the first column.  The currently selected solution will
also be displayed in the corresponding Extensive or Normal form
window.  To change the current solution (and thus change the display
in the corresponding Extensive or Normal form window), double click
(control-click in Linux) on the # of the desired solution.  To
quickly browse the solutions, the <EM>Update Solutions Dynamically</EM> 
option may be used.  With this option on, the solution will change
automatically once the cursor moves to a different solution #.
Double clicking on the first row deselects the current solution.<P>
Note that if the entries in the extensive or normal form are changed,
then any solutions to the game are deleted, and any link to an
associated extensive form game (if it existed) is broken.<P>
A variety of data dependent on the generating algorithm are available
for most Mixed or Behavior profiles. Not every category is relevant
for every profile.  If a certain data member is either not relevant or
not available, it will be displayed as <TT>----</TT>.  The display of
each data member is toggled in the Options dialog.  Note that the ID
data member is always displayed (it is an increasing (not necessarily
consecutive) index used to identify each solution)<P>
Solutions may be deleted by pressing the <B>Delete</B> button while the
solution is selected.  A solution may be edited by pressing the 
<A HREF="guiman25.html#SolnAddEdit">Edit</A> button, or a new one created with the 
<A HREF="guiman25.html#SolnAddEdit">Add</A> button.  Note that an edited or a newly
created solution will have <EM>User</EM> as the Creator and will have
most data members undefined.  Double clicking on any of the strategy
values will automatically call up the solution edit dialog.  To
facilitate working with a large number of solutions, the 
<A HREF="guiman24.html#SolnSortFilt">Sort/Filter</A> functionality is available.<P>

This dialog displays information about Mixed Strategy Profiles that
are either returned by algorithms or entered by the user.  This dialog
is accessed through the <B>View-&gt;Solution</B> selection in the normal
form menu.  <P>

The probabilities of each staratgy are arranged with each player on a
separate row, and strategies in consecutive columns.  Each cell
consists of the strategy number (or name), followed by a colon, and
followed by the probability of that strategy.  If the <EM>display
zero prob</EM> option is not turned on, strategies with zero probability
will not be displayed.<P>
The Extensive and Normal form Solution Inspect dialogs have many
features in common.  See the <A HREF="guiman21.html#SolutionInspect">Solution 
Inspect</A> for a description of these common features.<P>
If the underlying Normal Form game was generated from an Extensive
Form game, and if the link between the two is still valid, the <EM>
Mixed-&gt;Behav</EM> button will be enabled.  To project the solution to the
extensive form, and immediately display it there, press this button.<P>

This dialog displays information about Behavior Strategy Profiles that
are either returned by algorithms or entered by the user.  This dialog
is accessed through the <B>Inspect-&gt;Solution</B> selection in the
extensive form menu.<P>

The probability data for each information set is displayed on a
separate line.  The <B>Iset</B> column gives the infoset ID in the form
of (player #,iset #).  The next cell contains a vector of
probabilities in which each entry corresponds to an action that can be
taken at that infoset.  If a player has more than one infoset,
additional lines are used.  This format is repeated for each player in
the game.<P>
The Extensive and Normal form Solution Inspect dialogs have many
features in common.  See the <A HREF="guiman21.html#SolutionInspect">Solution 
Inspect</A> for a description of these common features.<P>
A useful feature when navigating large extensive form games is <EM>
Hilight Infosets</EM>.  It is toggled on or off from the EF window <B>
Inspect-&gt;Infosets</B>.  When enabled, double clicking on an infoset in
the EF window will hilight the corresponding infoset in the Solution
inspect window.  Double clicking on an infoset (Iset column) in the
Solution inspection window will hilight the corresponding infoset in
the EF window.<P>
For extensive form games, an additional level of solution inspection
is provided by the Node Inspect window.  The window may be turned
on/off through the <B>Inspect-&gt;Info</B> menu. When enabled, a small
window displays solution information pertaining to the cursor node.
The window can be dismissed by turning the option off in the same
menu.<P>

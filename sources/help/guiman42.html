<H3>Row and Column Players</H3>
 The row and column player choice boxes
determine which players' strategies get displayed on the horizontal and
vertical axis of the matrix.  You can select a new player by clicking on the 
arrow at the right of the box, and selecting a new player from the 
list of players in the game.  The dimensions of the matrix are
determined by the number of strategies for the row and column players.
Note that it is meaningless to select the same player for both the row and
the column.  If the game has more than two players, a warning will be
issued and no action will be taken.  In the case of a two player game, the
row and the column players will be switched.<P>

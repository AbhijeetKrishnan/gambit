<H3>QRE</H3>

Computes a branch of the logistic <EM>quantal response equilibrium</EM> 
correspondence for n-person normal form games (as described 
in [9]  and n-person extensive form games (as described 
in [10].) The branch is computed 
for values of lambda between minLam and maxLam.  The algorithm 
starts at lambda(0) = minLam if delLam &gt; 0, or 
lambda(0) = maxLam if 
delLam &lt; 0. It then increments according to the formula 
<CENTER></CENTER>
lambda(t+1) = lambda(t) +delLam lambda(t)^a.
<CENTER></CENTER>
where minLam, maxLam, delLam, and a are
parameters described below. In the computation for the first value of
lambda(0), the algorithm begins its search for a solution at the
starting point determined by the parameter <TT>start</TT>.  At each
successive value of lambda(t), the algorithm begins it's search at
the point found in step <TT>t - 1</TT>.  <P>
This algorithm returns the last point computed.  If the starting point
is set to the centroid of the game (this is the default), and delLam 
&gt; 0, then this algorithm computes the <EM>principal branch</EM> of the
logistic Quantal response equilibrium.  In this case taking the limit,
as lambda goes to 0, the quantal response equilibrium defines a
unique selection from the set of Nash equilibrium for generic normal
form games.  Similarly, for extensive form games, it defines a
selection from the set of sequential equilibria.  Therefore, in
extensive form games, this algorithm can be used to compute
approximations to a sequential equilibrium.<P>
<B>Limitations:</B> This algorithm currently can become numerically
unstable on some problems for high values of lambda, and may
generate singularity errors.  Hence on some problems it may not be
possible with the current implementation to obtain a sufficiently
close approximation to an equilibrium.<P>
The following parameters can be set:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> minLam:
<DD> Sets the minimum value of lambda. 
Default is lambda = 0.01.

</TD>
<DT> maxLam:
<DD> Sets the maximum value of lambda.  Default is 
lambda = 30.0.

</TD>
<DT> delLam:
<DD>  The constant, delta, used in incrementing.   Default is 
delta = .01.

</TD>
<DT> Plot type:
<DD> Determines the exponent, a, used in incrementing 
lambda.  <EM>Linear</EM> corresponds to setting a = 0, and <EM>
logarithmic</EM> corresponds to setting a = 1. Default is logarithmic.

</TD>
<DT> Starting Point:
<DD> Selects the rule for choosing the starting
point of the search for the initial value of lambda. <B>Default</B> 
is the centroid, where all strategies are chosen with equal
probability (not implemented yet.)

</TD>
<DT> Accuracy:
<DD> Sets the accuracy desired in the computation.
Default is 1.0e-8. 

</TD>
<DT> Run PXI:
<DD> A checkbox to determine whether to launch the external
PXI program to plot the QRE correspondence.  If this is checked, both
of the following fields must also be specified.

</TD>
<DT> PXI File:
<DD> Specifies a pathname to store the QRE correspondence
in a format compatible for input to PXI, a program for graphical
viewing and display of the output.

</TD>
<DT> PXI command:
<DD> Specifies the location of the pxi program.  A full
pathname should be specified.

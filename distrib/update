# $Id$
# An update script/makefile combination to create/update GAMBIT components
# and automatically place them onto the primary GAMBIT ftp site.

# Usage: 
#update TARGET=[gui,gcl,src,guidoc,gcldoc,all] 
#       HOST=[sun4,rs6000,solaris,hp,all] 
#       GUI=[motif,xview,all] SCCS=[true,false]
# update is an alias for 'make -f make.update'
# The SCCS argument should always be set to 'true' unless an update is desired
# using out-of-date files.
# This can be started on any of the hss machines and it will update the files
# on the appropriate platform using rsh.  Due to some SCCS weirdness, it is
# best to run the first update on HOST=sun4.  Since the GUI argument is not 
# used for any target except gui, it may be left out in other cases.  However,
# to save a LOT of disk space and some time by avoiding recompiling all the
# on-gui common files, it is better to set GUI=motif if it is not used. One
# problem with this approach is that the file 'gambitio.o' must be removed
# between the gui/gcl compiles (it is shared but not identical).

# A site configuration file must exist in the same directory.  It must be
# called make.site_$(GUI)_$(HOST) where GUI and HOST are appropriate to the
# machine.  If a nongui target is being built, _$(GUI) is set to 'none', or
# to 'motif' (see note above).

# Note that specifying 'all' for any of the parameters will attempt to build
# targets with the parameter set to each of its possible values succesively.
# This may produce some duplicate combinations if more than one of the 
# parameters is set to all.  Duplicate builds take very little time and are
# not a problem.  Thus, to rebuild ALL of the components the command would be:
# update HOST=all TARGET=all GUI=all SCCS=true

# Note on  Gambit source distribution.  The windows versions of gui&gcl require
# a few non-ascii files that can not be checked into SCCS.  These files
# (*.ide *.ico) must be placed in the distrib directory manually.

ITEM 0007:  Include file names not printable

DATE:     9/8/1999 by TLT (was Bug C31 in bugs_gcl)
AFFECTS:  GCL (MSWindows)
STATUS:   CLOSED 9/8/1999 by TLT
SEVERITY: MINOR
DETAILS:

Here, the GCL is being run from the directory c:\gambit96, and the
gclini.gcl and stdudfs.gcl files are in c:\gambit96\bin.

  Include["C:\gambit9in\gclini.gcl"]
  Include["C:\gambit9in\stdudfs.gcl"]
  GCL1: << Include["gcl\nqre.gcl"]
  True
  Include["gcl
  qre.gcl"]

Note that it does not print the names of the included files correctly,
even though it locates and loads them all correctly.  Evidently it is
treating the "\n" in the pathname "gcl\nqre.gcl" as a new line
character when it prints it even though it actually loads the file OK.
This is probably what is happening with the "\b" in "c:\gambit96\bin"
also.

COMMENTS
TLT 9/8/1999.  Fixed this by forcing all path names to have forward slashes,
regardless of operating system.  (This works fine for DOS paths.)

ITEM 0010:  GCL segfaults; orphan variables suspected

DATE:     9/8/1999 by TLT (was Bug C33 in bugs_gcl)
AFFECTS:  GCL (all platforms?)
STATUS:   CLOSED 9/9/1999 by TLT
SEVERITY: CRUCIAL
DETAILS:

Put the following commands in the file test.gcl

  e:= NewEfg[];
  P1 := NewPlayer[e, "P1"];
  e:= NewEfg[];
  P1 := NewPlayer[e, "P1"];
  e:= NewEfg[];
  P1 := NewPlayer[e, "P1"];

Then 

  Include["test.gcl"] leads to   

GCL1:= << Include["test.gcl"]     
True
A segmentation fault has occurred

On the other hand, if P1 is deallocated before each call, as in 

  e:= NewEfg[];
  P1 := NewPlayer[e, "P1"];
  e:= NewEfg[];
  P1:=;P1 := NewPlayer[e, "P1"];
  e:= NewEfg[];
  P1:=;P1 := NewPlayer[e, "P1"];

then it is OK.  Also, if the contents of test.gcl are run from the
command line, it is OK.

COMMENTS:
TLT 9/9/1999.  Turned out to be a problem in accurately keeping track
of references to games when using reference-type Portions.  This affected
all game types, not just EFPLAYER.

<H2>Branch</H2>

A branch is the line connecting two nodes, one of which immediately 
follows the other.  Branches are numbered from 1 to k, where k is the 
number of branches at the node.  Branch 1 is the uppermost branch.  Branch 
2 is the second uppermost branch, etc. <P>
In Figure 3.1, each decision node has two branches, but in
other extensive forms, the number of branches can be different.<P>

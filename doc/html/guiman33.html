<H3>Accelerators Dialog</H3>
<P>
Many frequently executed commands are much more efficiently entered
through the keyboard than by using a mouse.  To speed up the use of
the GUI for an experienced user, most of the 'mouseable' commands can
also be done by entering a combination of keys on the keyboard.  Both
the normal and the extensive forms possess this functionality.  The
accelerator key setting is accessed through the <B>Prefs-&gt;Accel</B> 
menu item.<P>

<P>
In this dialog, the event to be changed or defined is first selected
from the choicebox on the left.  If this event is associated with a
key combination already, the key will be displayed in the box on the
left, otherwise, the entries in the box will be blank.  A new key
combo can be assigned by selecting the combo in the box and pressing 
<B>Set</B>.  The association can be removed by selecting <B>None</B>.<P>
GAMBIT comes with a pre-defined set of accelerator keys described in
the corresponding <A HREF="guiman73.html#ExtFormDefAccl">extensive</A> and
<A HREF="guiman54.html#NormFormDefAccl">normal</A> sections.  Any of these default
command-key associations can be edited or removed.  <P>

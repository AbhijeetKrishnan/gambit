<H2>Topological Tree</H2>

A topological tree (also referred to as a Game tree) is simply a
collection of nodes which are connected together by branches in a way that
looks like a tree:  every node has at most one predecessor (parent), and exactly 
one node (the root node) has no predecessors.  
The Game tree represents a sequence of choices in the
chronological order that they occur. <P>

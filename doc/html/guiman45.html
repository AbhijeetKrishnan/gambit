<DT> Save:
<DD> Saves the normal form game to a file.  Normal form games
are written in a standard format and use the extension <TT>.nfg</TT>.
Note that the file format is forward, but not backward compatible:
Previous versions of Gambit may not be able to read files written by
this version, but this version should be able to read files written by
previous versions of Gambit.

</TD>
<DT> Output:
<DD> Outputs the normal form game.  The Output Media (REF NOT FOUND) dialog is used to select where to send the output. 

</TD>
<DT> Close:
<DD> Closes the normal form gui window, along with all child windows that depend on it.

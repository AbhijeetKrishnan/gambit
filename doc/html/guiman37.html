There are two positions where information can be displayed for each
branch (above and below.)  In each of these positions, you can select
to display information about the game tree (such as branch numbers or
action names), or information about the currently selected solution
(such as action probabilities or action values).  Similarly, there are
three positions at which information can be displayed for a node
(above, below, and to the right).  In the positions above and below
the node, you can select to display information about the game tree
(such as infoset name or ID), or information about the currently
selected solution (such as realization probabilities, node values,
belief probabilities). The position to the right of the node is
reserved for information relating to outcomes, and here you can select
to display the outcome name or outcome vector.<P>

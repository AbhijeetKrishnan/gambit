<H2>External Programs</H2>

One particularly useful feature of gambit is the ability to generate complete 
logistic quantal response correspondence for normal form games.  These
algorithms generate a very large amount of data that is not easily visualized.
To display this data we created a specialized data plotting program <EM>PXI</EM>.<P>

<P>
<EM>PXI</EM> was not funded from the same source as gambit itself, but was 
developed largely independently by Eugene Grayver.  PXI is not limited to
plotting data generated by gambit, but can be used to visualize a wide range
of econometric data.  It features four unique chart types, publication quality
graphics output, and an easy to use graphical interface.  PXI is available on
most platforms supported by gambit.  We strongly recommend using PXI if
either <A HREF="guiman86.html#QRE">QRE</A> or <A HREF="guiman87.html#QREAll">QREAll</A> algorithms are used.<P>
<HR>
 PXI is being released as <EM>shareware</EM> and its source code is available
upon request.

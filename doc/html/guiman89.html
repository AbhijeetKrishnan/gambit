Finds Nash equilibria via the Lyapunov function method
described in [16].  Works on either the extensive or normal
form.  This algorithm casts the problem as a function minimization
problem by use of a Lyapunov function for Nash equilibria.  This is a
continuously differentiable non negative function whose zeros coincide
with the set of Nash equilibria of the game.  A standard descent
algorithm is used to find a constrained local minimum of the function
from any given starting location.  Since a local minimum need not be a
global minimum (with value 0,) the algorithm is not guaranteed to find
a Nash equilibrium from any fixed starting point.  The algorithm thus
incorporates the capability of restarting.  The algorithm starts from
the initial starting point determined by the parameter 'start'.  If a
Nash equilibrium is not found, it will keep searching from new
randomly chosen starting points until a Nash equilibrium has been
found or the maximum number of tries (parameter 'ntries') is exceeded,
whichever comes first.  For an extensive form game, if the algorithm
converges, it converges to a sequential equilibrium (Andrew Solnick,
personal communication).<P>
<B>Limitations:</B> The disadvantages of this method are that it is
generally slower than any of the above methods, and also, there can be
local minima to the Liapunov function which are not zeros of the
function.  Thus the algorithm can potentially converge to a non Nash
point.  However, inspection of the objective function can determine if
this problem has occurred.  If the objective function is zero, a Nash
equilibrium has been found. If it is greater than zero, the point is
not Nash.  The algorithm will automatically check this.  If the
objective function is larger than the tolerance, then the point is
discarded.<P>
The following parameters can be set;<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Stop After:
<DD> Sets the number of equilibria to find.  Has a
default value of 1. Note that checking <B>Find all</B> results
(intentionally) in an infinite loop that will continue until
terminated by the user.

</TD>
<DT> nTries:
<DD> Sets the maximum number of attempts at finding each
equilibrium. Note that a value of 0 means the algorithm will continue
forever, or until the algorithm is terminated by the user, whichever
comes first.

</TD>
<DT> Accuracy:
<DD> Sets the accuracy desired in the computation.
Default is 1.0e-8. 

</TD>
<DT> start:
<DD> Sets the starting profile for the descent algorithm.
<B>Default</B> is the centroid.

<H2>Action</H2>

An action is a collection of branches, one at each node of a player's information 
set, which are indistinguishable to the player making a decision at that 
information set. <P>
In Figure 3.1, each information set has two actions.  For the 
second player, at her information set, the two branches labeled MEET are one 
action, and the two branches labeled PASS are another action.

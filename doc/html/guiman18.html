<H2>File menu</H2>
<P>
The <B>File</B> menu is used to launch gambit, by either loading a new
game or loading a previously saved game.<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> New:
<DD> Used to create a new normal or extensive form game. 
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Normal:
<DD> You must input the number of players and the number of
strategies for each player, and then the <A HREF="guiman40.html#NFGUI">Normal Form 
GUI</A> is started with a default normal for game of that
dimension.  The default game has no outcomes defined.  So all payoffs
are zero.

</TD>
<DT> Extensive:
<DD> You must select the number of players (default is
two), and then the <A HREF="guiman55.html#EFGUI">Extensive Form GUI</A> is started with
a default game, which consists of the trivial game with only one node
(the root node) and no actions for the players.  The <A HREF="guiman61.html#efedit">Edit 
Menu</A> in the extensive form GUI is then used to build up the
desired game.
</DL>


</TD>
<DT> Open:
<DD> You will get a standard File Selector dialog box from
which you can either directly enter the name of the file to open, or
browse the directory system for the desired file.  Files containing
extensive form games are given the default extension of <TT>.efg</TT> in
Gambit, and files containing normal form games are given the default
extension <TT>.nfg</TT>. If you select a normal form file, you will
bring up the <A HREF="guiman40.html#NFGUI">Normal Form GUI</A> module.  If you select
an extensive form file, you will bring up the <A HREF="guiman55.html#EFGUI">Extensive Form
GUI</A>.  When you save an extensive or normal form game in
Gambit, it is written in a standard format. Note that the file format
is forward, but not backward compatible: Previous versions of Gambit
may not be able to read files written by this version, but this
version should be able to read files written by previous versions of
Gambit.

</TD>
<DT> Quit:
<DD> Quits the Gambit GUI, and closes all child windows.  
</DL>

<H2>Terminal Node</H2>

A terminal node is a node which has no other node following it.  Terminal 
nodes represent points at which the extensive form game ends, and typically 
have outcomes attached to them. <P>
In Figure 3.1, there are six terminal nodes, each followed by
a pair of numbers representing the payoffs to each player when that
terminal node is reached.<P>

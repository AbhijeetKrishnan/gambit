<H2>The Extensive Form</H2>
<P>
The extensive form is a detailed description of a sequence of decisions 
that must be made by a group of individuals. To illustrate the basic ideas,
 Figure 3.1 
shows how the extensive form of a simple 
<A HREF="guiman108.html#pokergloss">two player poker game</A> (from [1] is represented
 in the Gambit GUI.  <P>

  a Simple Two Player Poker Game
<P>
In Gambit, the extensive form <A HREF="guiman117.html#toptreegloss">game tree</A>, is drawn with the 
<A HREF="guiman112.html#rootnodegloss">root node</A> being the node furthest to the left,
branches going from left to right, and successive 
nodes to the right of 
their predecessors.  So nodes further to the right represent decisions 
that occur later in time.  Each player, (including chance) is represented by a color.  <P>
A <A HREF="guiman106.html#nodegloss">node</A> is represented as a horizontal line.  Every
non-terminal node is a <A HREF="guiman99.html#decnodegloss">decision node</A> and is
represented by the color of the player who makes a decision at that
node.  Nodes are connected by <A HREF="guiman97.html#branchgloss">branches</A>, which
are represented by two connected line segments, the "fork'' and the
"tine''.  The fork is used in the graphics display to indicate
graphically the probabilities of taking each branch.  The tine is used
as a location at which to display textual information about the
branch.  In gambit <A HREF="guiman107.html#outcomegloss">Outcomes</A> can be attached to
either non terminal or terminal nodes and can be displayed either by
label or by payoff next to the node to which they are attached.<P>
<A HREF="guiman104.html#infosetgloss">Information sets</A> in Gambit are identified by a
pair of numbers, the first representing the player number and the
second representing the information set number.  This information can
be displayed on the extensive form next to each node to identify which
nodes are in which information sets.  Whenever possible information
sets are also represented by vertical lines connecting the nodes that
are members of the same information set.  It is only possible to do
this when nodes in the same information set are at the same level of
the tree.  When two member nodes of the same information set are not
at the same level, the information set is indicated by a "lagged''
line, the end of which points in the direction of the next node, as
illustrated in Figure 3.2.<P>

<H3>Navigating the Extensive Form</H3>

The cursor is indicated on the display of the normal form by a 
solid or flashing dark line above 
one of the nodes or by a dark triangle around a subgame icon. 
The cursor position is used by many of the tree building functions.  
You can move the cursor around the extensive form game 
either by use of the arrow keys or by using the mouse.  <P>
When the extensive form 
game becomes large, only a window into the extensive form game is displayed.  
As you move the cursor around the game tree, the window will redraw 
the game tree when necessary to keep the cursor visible. <P>
For large games, the whole game tree will not be visible at one time.  If you 
want to see more of the game tree, you can change the magnification by 
using the <TT>Prefs-&gt;Zoom</TT> menu.  You can also use the <TT>-</TT> and 
<TT>+</TT> keys to change the magnification by constant increments. When 
editing a large game, if the magnification level is too small, you may 
not be able to read the textual information displayed on the game tree.  You 
can use the <EM>Zoom Window</EM>, which can be enabled in the 
<TT>Inspect-&gt;ZoomWindow</TT> menu to get a magnified view of the tree 
at the cursor location.  <P>

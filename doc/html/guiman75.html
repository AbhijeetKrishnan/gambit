<H2>Supports</H2>
<P>
A support is a subset of the strategies or actions of a game which is
of interest for some reason.  Usually the reason for looking at a
support that is less than the full support is to eliminate dominated
strategies.  All of the solution algorithms in Gambit take the current
support as an argument.  When starting analysis of any game, the
current support is the full support of the game.  New supports are
created either through elimination of dominated strategies or explicit
creation of a support.  This functionality is accessed via the <B>
Support</B> menu item in either the <A HREF="guiman47.html#nfsupports">Normal Form</A> or
<A HREF="guiman63.html#efsupport">Extensive Form</A> GUI.<P>

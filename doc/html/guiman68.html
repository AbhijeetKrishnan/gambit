<H3>Subgames</H3>

Gambit implements and supports the concept of a game theoretical
subgame. For the conditions necessary for a subtree to be qualified as
a subgame, see [4].  Gambit can be made to selectively
recognize some, none, or all of the legal subgames in its solution
algorithms through the technique of marking subgames.<P>
When an extensive form is first created or read in from a file, no
subgames (except for the default ROOT subgame) are marked.  If a node
is the root of a marked subgame, a small triangle is drawn at its
base.  Subgames can be collapsed for the purpose of better vieing a
large tree.  If a subgame is collapsed, all of the nodes it contains
are not displayed but replaced by a subgame icon.  Shift-clicking
(holding down the <EM>SHIFT</EM> key while clicking the left mouse
button) on a subgame root node will toggle the state of that subgame
(expanded vs. collapsed).  Refer to the following picture for an
example of subgame structures.<P>

All of the solution algorithms (with the current exception of the 
QRE algorithms) make use of the marked subgames.  When non-trivial 
subgames are defined, then the solution algorithms will solve the 
extensive form game by recursion through the marked subgames.  Thus, a 
subgame is solved only when all subgames following it have been 
solved.  <P>
If all subgames are marked, then any Nash equilibrium found will be a
subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.  Note that the solution algorithms
only respect marked subgames, and hence if you want the solution
algorithms to make use of subgames, you must mark the subgames.  When
an algorithm encounters a subgame, the subgame is solved by itself and
the rest of the tree is resolved for each of the subgame solutions.
Clearly, the total number of solutions grows exponentially with the
number of subgames.  For advanced users, the <B>
Solve-&gt;Custom-&gt;Extensive-&gt;Algorithm</B> dialog provides the option to
interactively select which solutions are used for each subgame.  This
feature lets the advanced user concentrate on solutions of interest
while keeping the total number of solutions small.<P>

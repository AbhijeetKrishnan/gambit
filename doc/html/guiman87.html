<H3>QRE Grid</H3>

Performs a grid search to compute the complete logistic
quantal response correspondence (as described in [9]
for a <EM>small</EM> two-person normal form game.<P>
The algorithm computes approximate fixed points of the correspondence
for the correspondence for values of lambda between <TT>minLam</TT>
and <TT>maxLam</TT>.  Starting at lambda = minLam, lambda is
incremented according to the formula <CENTER></CENTER> lambda(t+1) = lambda(t)
+delLam lambda(t)^a.<CENTER></CENTER> where minLam, maxLam, delLam, and a
are parameters described below. For each value of lambda, a grid
search is done over all values of the probabilities for player 1,
evaluated on a grid of mesh 'del p.'  Points are evaluated in terms of
the value of an objective function that measures the distance between
the original point, and the best response to the best response (under
the logistic best response function.)  Points with a value of the
objective function less than <TT>Tolerance</TT> are approximate fixed
points, and are kept, others are discarded.  A two stage procedure is
used, in which the entire space is searched on a course grid of mesh
'delp1'.  Any points on the course grid for which the value of the
objective function is less than 'tol1' are then searched on a finer
grid of mesh 'delp2' around that point.  Points on the finer grid for
which the value of the objective function is below 'tol2' = 'tol' are
kept.<P>
<B>Limitations:</B> This algorithm is <B>very</B> computationally
intensive, and should only be attampted on small games.<P>
The following parameters can be set for <B>QRE Grid</B>.<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> minLam:
<DD> Sets the minimum value of lambda.
Default is lambda = .01.

</TD>
<DT> maxLam:
<DD>  Sets the maximum value of lambda.
Default is lambda = 3. 

</TD>
<DT> delLam:
<DD> Specifies the rate at which the value of Lambda changes.
Has a default value of .1.

</TD>
<DT> Plot Type:
<DD> Specifies whether to have geometric or linear incrementing.
Default is 0, resulting in a = 1, or !geometric incrementing.

</TD>
<DT> Grid 1 Del:
<DD> Grid size for search over course grid of probability space.

</TD>
<DT> Grid 1 Tol:
<DD> Maximum value of objective function for which to accept
solution on course grid.

</TD>
<DT> Use MultiGrid:
<DD> Checking this box causes the two stage procedure
to be used, in which case the next two parameters neet to also be
specified.

</TD>
<DT> Grid 2 Del:
<DD> Grid size for search over fine grid of probability space.  

</TD>
<DT> Grid 2 Tol:
<DD> Maximum value of objective function for which to
accept solution on fine grid.

</TD>
<DT> Run PXI:
<DD> A checkbox to determine whether to launch the external
PXI program to plot the QRE correspondence.  If this is checked, both
of the following fields must also be specified.

</TD>
<DT> PXI File:
<DD> Specifies a pathname to store the QRE correspondence
in a format compatible for input to PXI, a program for graphical
viewing and display of the output.

</TD>
<DT> PXI command:
<DD> Specifies the location of the pxi program.  A full
pathname should be specified.

<H3>Two Person Games</H3>

For two person nonzero sum games, the problem of finding Nash
equilibria can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem, and
exact solutions can be found as long as computations are done in
rationals.  The <A HREF="guiman88.html#Lcp">Lcp algorithm</A> solves a two person game
using this approach.  Note that the Lcp algorithm can also be used
directly on an extensive form game, where it implements the Koller,
Megiddo, von Stengel Sequence form [7].  To find <EM>
one</EM> Nash equilibrium use Lcp with nEquilib set to 1.<P>
For a two person game the <A HREF="guiman84.html#EnumMixed">EnumMixed algorithm</A> 
will enumerate all of the extreme points of the components of the set
of Nash equilibria, and hence can be used to find <EM>all</EM> Nash
equilibria.  Using EnumMixed with nEquilib set to 0 will find all Nash
equilibria.  To find if there is more than one Nash equilibrium use
EnumMixed with nEquilib set to 2.<P>

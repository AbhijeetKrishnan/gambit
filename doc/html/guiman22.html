<P>
The probabilities of each staratgy are arranged with each player on a
separate row, and strategies in consecutive columns.  Each cell
consists of the strategy number (or name), followed by a colon, and
followed by the probability of that strategy.  If the <EM>display
zero prob</EM> option is not turned on, strategies with zero probability
will not be displayed.<P>
The Extensive and Normal form Solution Inspect dialogs have many
features in common.  See the <A HREF="guiman21.html#SolutionInspect">Solution 
Inspect</A> for a description of these common features.<P>
If the underlying Normal Form game was generated from an Extensive
Form game, and if the link between the two is still valid, the <EM>
Mixed-&gt;Behav</EM> button will be enabled.  To project the solution to the
extensive form, and immediately display it there, press this button.<P>

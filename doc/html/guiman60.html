<DT> Save:
<DD> Saves the extensive form game to a file.  Extensive form
games are written in a standard format and use the extension <TT>

Previous versions of Gambit may not be able to read files written by
this version, but this version should be able to read files written by
previous versions of Gambit.

</TD>
<DT> Output:
<DD> Outputs the extensive form game.  The Output
Media (REF NOT FOUND) dialog is used to select where to send the output.

</TD>
<DT> Close:
<DD> Closes the extensive form gui window, along with all
child windows that depend on it.

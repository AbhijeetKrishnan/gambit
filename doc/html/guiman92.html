Computes a Nash equilibrium to a normal form game based on a
simplicial subdivision algorithm.  The algorithm implemented is that
of [17].  The algorithm is a simplicial subdivision
algorithm which can start at any point in the simplex.  The algorithm
starts with a given grid size, follows a path of almost completely
labeled subsimplexes, and converges to a completely labeled
sub-simplex that approximates the solution.  Additional accuracy is
obtained by refining the grid size and restarting from the previously
found point.  The idea is that by restarting at a close approximation
to the solution, each successive increase in accuracy will yield a
short path, and hence be quick.<P>
In its pure form, the algorithm is guaranteed to find at least one
mixed strategy equilibrium to any n-person game.  Experience shows
that the algorithm works well, and is acceptably fast for many
moderate size problems.  But in some examples it can be quite slow.
The reason for this is that sometimes after restarting with a refined
grid size, even though the starting point is a good approximation to
the solution, the algorithm will go to the boundary of the simplex
before converging back to a point that is close to the original
starting point.  When this occurs, each halving of the grid size will
take twice as long to converge as the previous grid size.  If a high
degree of accuracy is required, or if the normal form is large, this
can result in the algorithm taking a long time to converge.<P>
In order to combat the above difficulty, a parameter 'leash' has been
added to the algorithm which places a limit on the distance which the
algorithm can wander from the restart point. (Setting this parameter
to 0 results in no limit, and gives the pure form of the algorithm.)
With this parameter set to a non trivial value, the algorithm is no
longer guaranteed to converge, and setting small values of the
parameter will sometimes yield lack of convergence.  However,
experience shows that values of the parameter on the order of 10
generally do not destroy convergence, and yield much faster
convergence.<P>
Parameters:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Stop after:
<DD> Maximum number of equilibria to find. Default is 1.  

</TD>
<DT> n Restarts:
<DD> Number of restarts.  At each restart the mesh of the
triangulation is halved.  So this parameter determines the final mesh
by the formula 1/2^ndivs.

</TD>
<DT> Leash:
<DD> Sets the leashlength. Default is 0, which results in no
constraint, or no leash.

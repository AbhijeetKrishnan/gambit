<H2>Information Set</H2>

An information set is a collection of nodes which are all controlled by
the same player, but which are indistinguishable 
for the player who is making the decision.  Since any two nodes 
in the same information set are indistinguishable, they must have exactly 
the same number of immediately following nodes. <P>
In Figure 3.1, player 1 has two information
sets, labeled (1, 1) and (1, 2), and player 2 has one, labeled (2, 1).
Player 2 has only one information set because Player 2 does not know whether
 Player 1 drew a red card or a black card from the deck.  So 2's decision 
cannot be contingent on that information.<P>

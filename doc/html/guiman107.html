<H2>Outcome</H2>

Outcomes are payoff vectors that associate with each player a payoff.  
Outcomes can be attached to any node, terminal or non terminal, in the 
extensive form of the game.  When play passes or terminates at a node 
with an outcome attached to it, each player accumulates the payoff which 
is associated to that player by the outcome at that node. <P>
In Figure 3.1, there is an outcome attached to each of the
terminal nodes.  They are indicated by the pair of numbers at each
terminal node.  The first number represents the payoff to player 1 and the
second the payoff to player 2.<P>

<H3>Table Window</H3>

The table window is used several places in GAMBIT.  It offers a large
number of possible configuration options.  Gambit will attempt to
choose the most suitable settings for each use, but Since Gambit runs
on many different platforms, the default settings may not be suitable
for your platform.  The following settings can be set:<P>
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Font:
<DD> Selects the font to be used for the Labels and/or Data in
the display.

</TD>
<DT> Column Width:
<DD> The program will usually select the cell width to
fit the widest item in the table.  However, if an unusually long name
is used, this width may be insufficient.  The scrollbar controls the
width of the cell, measured either in character width's or pixels.
Character based sizing is default and is recommended.  If for some
reason more precise dimensioning is desired, or if the cell width is
not to change with the font size, the <EM>char</EM> checkbox should be
unchecked.  The width can be changed for a single column by choosing
the desired column # in the <EM>Col</EM> choicebox or for all the
columns by choosing All in the choicebox (default).

</TD>
<DT> Show Labels:
<DD> It is possible to turn off the row and column
labels by unchecking their corresponding checkboxes.  However, this is
not recommended since frequently important information is contained in
those labels.

</TD>
<DT> Color Text:
<DD> Some instances of the table window employ colored
text for clearer presentation of the data (i.e. the normal form,
solution inspection windows).  The only reason to turn this feature
off is to speed up display on very slow computer or over very slow
networks.

</TD>
<DT> Decimal Places:
<DD> The number of digits displayed after the
decimal point in all floating point numbers is controlled by this
slider.  Note that this setting does not in any way effect the actual
precision of the calculations.
</DL>
<P>
All of these features can be saved to a defaults file (gambit.ini).  They
will be taken into account the next time the table window is used, as long
as they are not overridden by the program.<P>

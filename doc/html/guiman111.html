<H2>Reduced Normal Form</H2>

The reduced normal form is the game that results when all strategies that 
are identical (result in  the same payoffs for all contingencies of the 
other players are represented by a single strategy.  <P>
In many extensive form games, there are cases in which a choice adopted by 
a player early in the play precludes that player from ever reaching other 
of its information sets.  In this situation, the decisions that the player 
makes at the unreached information sets can not possibly affect the  payoff
 to that player(or to any other player).  Two strategies for a given player
 that differ only in what branch is selected at an unreachable'  information
 set will generate rows (or columns, as the case may be) in the normal form 
that are identical.  The reduced normal form eliminates such duplicated 
strategies, representing each duplicated strategy by its wildcard notation.  <P>

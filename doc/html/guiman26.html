<H3>Output Media Dialog</H3>
<P>
Many of the windows in Gambit have a menu item which can be 
selected to generate output to a printer or a file.  When you select this 
option, you will get a dialog box which will ask the medium to which the 
output is to be generated.  <P>

your screen is output.<P>

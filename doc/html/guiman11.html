<H2>Strategies and The Normal Form</H2>
<P>
A pure strategy for a player is a function that 
associates with each of 
its information sets, a chosen action at that information set.  A pure 
strategy n-tuple is a vector of strategies, one for each player.  
The normal form for a game is a mapping which associates with each pure 
strategy n--tuple, an expected payoff to each player from 
playing that strategy. <P>
In the extensive form of the game in GAMBIT, the information sets for a 
player are numbered from <TT>1</TT> to <TT>J</TT>, where <TT>J</TT> is the number of information 
sets that player <TT>i</TT> has.  We denote the pure strategy in which player <TT>i</TT> 
adopts strategy <TT>a</TT> in its first information set, <TT>b</TT> in its second, and 
<TT>c</TT> in its third <TT>abc</TT>.  So if player <TT>i</TT> has three information sets, where 
the first two information sets contain three branches and the last contains 
two branches, then player <TT>i</TT> has a total of <TT>18</TT> strategies, 
and <TT>312</TT> indicates the strategy where the player chooses the third 
branch at its first information set, the first branch at its second 
information set, and the second branch at its third information set.  <P>
In the extensive form of <A HREF="guiman8.html#extformsec">Figure 3.1</A>,
Player 1 has two information sets, each with two choices, so it has a
total of four strategies.  They are <TT>11, 12, 21 </TT> and <TT>22</TT>.
Player 2 has one information set, with two branches, so they are
labeled <TT>1</TT> and <TT>2</TT>.  The strategy <TT>21</TT> for player 1
represents the strategy of choosing FOLD with a Red card, and RAISE
with a Black card.

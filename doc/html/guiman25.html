Figure 4.5: Edit Mixed Solution Dialog Box
<P>
Gambit allows the user to add a new mixed or behavior profile or edit
an existing solution for the purpose of investigating its properties.
Note that profiles that are added or edited do not have to have
probabilities that add to one.<P>
These features are accessed via the <B>Add</B> and <B>Edit</B> buttons
in the solution inspect window.  The probabilities for each strategy
can be edited by moving the cursor to the appropriate cell in the Edit
Mixed Solution dialog box.  Selecting <TT>OK</TT> will cause the profile
to be added to the list of solutions in the Solution Inspect window.
Any profile that is added or edited will appear in the Solution
Inspect Window with a creator of <TT>User</TT>.  When a solution is
edited, typically its properties will change.<P>

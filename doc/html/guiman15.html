<H3>perfect recall</H3>

A game of perfect recall is a game in which individuals do not forget what
they have known or done earlier in the game (see, eg., [1]).  
This requires that
information sets must refine earlier information sets, and if there is
an information set, one of whose nodes follows a choice by the same player
at a previous information set, then all of the members of that information
set must follow the same choice.<P>
GAMBIT does not enforce perfect recall on the extensive form games that
you build.  However, certain algorithms in GAMBIT only work on games of 
perfect recall.  
To find out if a game is perfect recall, you can go to the <TT>Inspect-&gt;GameInfo</TT> 
menu.  GAMBIT will allow you to convert a game without perfect recall 
to normal form and solve for optimal 
mixed strategies.  The problem comes in converting the mixed strategy back
to a behavioral strategy.  If the game has perfect recall, then by Kuhn's 
theorem (see eg., [2]), any mixed strategy can be 
converted back to a behavioral strategy which is realization equivalent.   
If the game does not have perfect recall, this is not always possible.  
In this case, attempting to convert a mixed to a behavior strategy 
may yield unpredictable results which do not correspond to a valid 
behavior strategy.   <P>

<H3>NFG Custom Solutions</H3>

Only a user familiar with the algorithms should use the custom
settings since the program makes no attempt to check for the validity
of some of the parameters.  For a detailed discussion of the 
<A HREF="guiman83.html#SolutionAlgorithms">algorithms</A> see the appropriate sections.<P>
A custom algorithm is selected in the <B>Solve-&gt;Custom</B> submenu.
Each solution algorithm is controlled by two groups of settings, both
of which are set on the dialog box for the particular algorithm.
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Dominance elimination:
<DD> Prior to running the algorithm,
dominated strategies may be eliminated, thus speeding up the
consequent calculations.  The type of dominace elimination is
controlled by three radioboxes at the top the dialog box for the
algorithm.
<DL>


</TD>
<DT> Depth:
<DD> Determines whether and how much dominance
elimination is to be done.  <B>None</B> indicates no dominance
elimination, <B>Once</B> selects a single step of elimination, and <B>
Iterative</B> selects iterative elimination of dominated strategies.

</TD>
<DT> Type:
<DD> Determines whether to use <B>weak</B> or <B>strong</B>
domination.

</TD>
<DT> Method:
<DD> Determines whether to eliminate strategies that are
dominated only by pure strategies or whether to also eliminate
strategies dominated by mixed strategies.  Elimination by pure
strategies is faster, but may not find all dominated strategies, as it
is possible that strategies that are not dominated by any pure
strategy may be dominated by a mixed strategy.
</DL>


</TD>
<DT> Algorithm parameters:
<DD> The remainder of the dialog box is used
for setting parameters that are specific to the algorithm.  These
parameters will differ from algorithm to algorithm.  The settings for
the particular algorithm are described in the 
<A HREF="guiman83.html#SolutionAlgorithms">algorithms</A> section.
</DL>
<P>
Note that some algorithms require a starting point.  Depending on the
options selected in the custom parameters dialog for these algorithms,
a starting point dialog may pop up before the algorithm is run.  The
default (centroid) is usually the best place to start.  Double
clicking on the first profile in the window and pressing <TT>Ok</TT> will
select the default and allow the algorithm to continue. Advanced users
may choose to enter a different starting point, such as profiles
resulting from the use of other algorithms.<P>

<H2>Platforms</H2>

The gambit <A HREF="guiman101.html#guigloss">GUI</A> is developed and tested primarily
on the following platforms:
<UL>

<LI> IBM PC and compatibles running MS Windows 95/98 or NT.
<LI> Linux operating systems using Motif. 
</UL>
<P>
Executable code for the above platforms as well as certain other
platforms is available at the Gambit web site (check the gambit web
page for current information).<P>
For platforms that are not currently supported, the gambit source code
is available at our web site.  The gambit GUI relies on the wxWin
library, and versions could be compiled for any platform that is
supported by wxWin.  See the gambit and wxWin web sites for more
details<P>

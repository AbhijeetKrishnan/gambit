<title>The Gambit tools</title>

<para>
Gambit provides an array of programs for manipulating and analyzing games.
This chapter describes these programs in detail.

<sect1 id="utils.nash">
<title>Programs for computing Nash equilibria</title>
<para>
This section describes the implementations of various methods for
computing Nash equilibria provided by Gambit.  For a general overview
of the formulations of the Nash equilibrium problem, see the survey
of McKelvey and McLennan (1996) [<xref linkend="McKMcL96">].
</para>

<para>
By convention, these programs take an extensive or strategic game file
on standard input, and output a list of equilibria computed.  The
equilibria computed are presented as a list of comma-separated probabilities,
preceded by the tag &quot;NE&quot;.  Many of the programs optionally
output additional information about the operation of the algorithm;
these outputs have other, program-specific tags, described in the
individual program documentation.

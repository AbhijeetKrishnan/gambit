\chapter*{Acknowledgments}\label{gambitproject}

The Gambit Project is a project for the development of computer code
for the solution of extensive and normal form games.  The software
developed under the project is public domain. The Gambit Project is
funded in part by National Science Foundation grants SBR-9308637 and
SBR-9617854 to the California Institute of Technology and SBR-9308862
to the University of Minnesota.

The Gambit Project is an ongoing project, where the set of active
participants has changed over time, and will be expected to change
further in the future.  The main contributors to this release are
Richard D. McKelvey, Andrew McLennan and Theodore Turocy.  However, this
release builds heavily on the previous releases, and we would be
remiss not to acknowledge the significant contributions of those
involved in those previous releases.

The Gambit project was begun in the mid 80's, at which time it
consisted of an implementaion of the GUI in Basic.  The code has since
been totally rewritten twice (first in C, then in C++), the
functionality has been expanded, and the GCL has been developed as an
alternative to the GUI to support econometric and computationally
intensive use.

Richard McKelvey has directed the Gambit project since its inception
in the mid 80's, and was one of the principal investigators on the NSF
grants for the Gambit Project.  He designed the original GUI, was
involved in the design of the GCL (1993), and has been responsible for
implementation of many of the algorithms in gambit.

Andrew McLennan has worked on the project since 1993, and was one of
the principal investigators on the NSF grants for the Gambit project.
Andy was involved in the original design of the GCL (1993).  He has
been responsible for the implementation of the polynomial solution
code, which finds all roots of polynomial systems of equations, and
(effective this release) is used as the default algorithm to find all
Nash equilibria of n-person games, when n is greater than two.

Ted Turocy has worked on the project since 1992, working full time for
a year and a half of that time.  He has been the main programmer for
the project, also responsible for supervising other programmers
working on the project.  Ted converted the code from C to C++, changed
it to an object oriented style, wrote code for the container classes
and for the current implementaton of the extensive and normal form
classes, and implemented the GCL.  He also made substantial
improvements to the GUI for this release.

In listing the contributors to previous releases, we must
first mention Eugene Grayver and Gary Wu, each of whom worked
for at least four years on the project, making major contributions:

Eugene Grayver worked on the project from 1994 through 1997.
He wrote the code for the wxWindows implementation of the GUI for versions
0.92 through 0.94, developed the initial Gambit webpage, handled the software
distributions, and implemented the console interface for version 0.94
of the GCL.

Gary Wu worked from 1995 through 1998 on the project.  He was
responsible for large portions of the GCL implementation, including
the implementation of ``listability'', implementation of many of the
built in functions, the command line editor, the original stack
machine, and the Windows MFC interface used through version 0.96 for the GCL.

Numerous additional students at Caltech and the University of Minnesota
have contributed to the Gambit Project:

Bruce Bell worked in 1989 on the first $C$ version of the Gambit GUI,
which was distributed in 1991-92 as version .13, and later (1994-1995)
helped with the implementation of the tableau and LU decomposition
code (used in the two person LCP and LP algorithms). Matthew Derer
worked in the summer of 1993 to do an initial implementation of the
GUI for XWindows.  Anand Chelian worked summer of 1994 to do an
initial implementation of the matrix and vector classes.  Brian
Trotter worked summer of 1994 on internals of the container classes
and the extensive form classes.  Todd Kaplan worked in the summer of
1994 and did initial work towards implementaion of a multivariate
polynomial class.  Nelson Escobar worked over the summer of 1995 to
improve the LUDecomposition code, and worked on a second
implementation of the polynomial classes.  Rob Weber did extensive
testing from 1994 to 1996, and helped with the documentation of
version .94.  Geoff Matters worked summer of 1997 to make various
improvements to the LP solver and on improvements to the built in
function definitions in the GCL.  Ben Freeman worked in the summer of
1998 to implement the integer tableau class, which is used to speed up
the rational computations for two person games.  Michael Vanier worked
summer of 1998 through the spring of 1999 to set up the CVS repository
system for source code control, work on the distribution scripts, and
make various bug fixes to the GUI.

We are also indebted to Bernhard von Stengel at the London School of
Economics for help and advice on implementation of the sequence form
and for contributing his ``clique'' code for identification of
equilibrium components in two person games.

\chapter{Introduction}

Gambit is a library of computer programs, written
in \verb$C++$, for building, analyzing, and solving n-person games, in
either extensive or normal form.

The Gambit Graphical User Interface (GUI) is an
interactive, menu driven program for accessing this library of programs.
The Gambit GUI allows for the interactive building and solving of
extensive and normal form games.  It consists of two separate modules, one
for extensive and the other for normal form games.   In each module, you
can build, save load and solve a game, and convert back and forth from one
form of game to the other.

The Gambit GUI is not suitable for repetitive or
computer intensive  operations.  A separate program, the Gambit Command
Language (\popref{GCL}{gclgloss}) is designed to be used for such operations 
on games.  The
GCL is a program which allows access to the functionality of the gambit
library of programs through a high level programming language.  The
Gambit GUI and GCL  are compatible with each other, in the sense that they
each generate files that can be read by the other, and they call the same
underlying library of functions.


\chapter{Hardware and Installation}
\section{Operating systems}
The Gambit \popref{GUI}{guigloss}\ is developed and tested primarily
on the following operating systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Microsoft Windows 95, 98, 2000 or NT.  The binaries should also
work on other compatible flavors of Windows, but are generally not tested
extensively there.
\item Linux, using the GTK+ (Gnome) toolkit.  
\end{itemize}

Executable code for the above platforms as well as certain other
platforms is available at the Gambit web site (check the Gambit web
page for current information).

For platforms that are not currently supported, the Gambit source code
is available at our web site.  The Gambit GUI, and the windowed interface 
to the command language, are built on top of the wxWindows\footnote{The
wxWindows home page is \texttt{http://www.wxwindows.org}.} cross-platform
windowing library, and versions could be compiled for any platform currently
supported by wxWindows.

\section{Installation}
All of the Gambit files can be found at the Gambit World Wide Web site
at

\chapter{Quick Start: A Poker Example}

This chapter takes a high-level tour of the Gambit interface using
as an example the simple one-card poker game appearing in
Myerson \cite{Mye:91}.  This game is included in the Gambit distribution
as \texttt{poker.efg}, and can be found in the \texttt{efg} subdirectory
of the directory in which Gambit is installed.  (For example, in the
standard installation under Microsoft Windows, this would be
\texttt{c:/gambit/efg/poker.efg}.)  By convention, files ending in
\texttt{.efg} store extensive form games, and files ending in
\texttt{.nfg} store normal form games. 

When launched, Gambit displays a window similar to that displayed in
Figure XX.\footnote{All the screenshots contained in this manual were
taken on a system running XXXXX.  If you use a different operating system,
your windows may appear slightly differently.}  This window contains
a trivial extensive form game, containing exactly one node, which is both
root and terminal.  Chapter XX describes how to use the extensive form
window to construct and edit extensive form games.

There are three equivalent ways to open a saved game from any window in Gambit:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Select the \textbf{Open} menu item from the \textbf{File} menu;
\item Use the shortcut key combination \textbf{[Ctrl]-O};
\item Click on the file folder icon on the toolbar.
\end{enumerate}
Any of these actions leads to a dialog box for selecting a file to
load.  Use the dialog to locate and select the \texttt{poker.efg}
file.  After doing so, Gambit will display the opened game in a new
window, as shown in Figure XXX.  The screenshot in Figure XXX shows
the game as rendered by Gambit using the default settings.  Many
display options are available to customize the appearance of games;
see Section XXX for details.

The extensive form game tree is drawn with the root node at far left,
with branches going from left to right, and successive nodes to the
right of their predecessors.  Each node is represented as a horizontal
line.  Every non-terminal node is a decision node and is represented
by the color of the player who makes a decision at that node.  Nodes
are connected by branches, which are represented by two connected line
segments, which can be thought of as the ``fork'' and the ``tine''.
The fork is used in the graphics display to indicate graphically the
probabilities of taking each branch.  The tine is used as a location
at which to display textual information about the branch.

The poker game begins with Chance selecting either a Red card or
a Black card to deal to Player~1.  This is represented in the tree
by the grey node and subsequent branches labeled ``Red'' and ``Black''.
The forks of the branches have superimposed black lines stretching
halfway along the fork, indicating a probability of one-half that
each card is chosen.  After each of the two possible draws, Player~1,
whose nodes are colored in red, has the option to either ``Raise'' or
``Fold''.  If Player~1 folds, the game ends; if he raises, Player~2,
with nodes colored in green,
then has the option to either ``Meet'' or ``Pass''; in either case,
the game ends after Player~2's choice.   All terminal nodes are drawn
in black.

In this game, outcomes are attached to each of the six terminal
nodes, and payoffs to the two players are indicated to the right
of the corresponding node, with Player~1's payoff listed first, then
Player~2's.  Outcomes are indicated to the right of nodes, but may
be attached to nonterminal nodes, in which case their payoffs are 
interpreted as incremental payoffs.   Outcomes may also be displayed
by textual name rather than by their payoff vector.

Information sets are identified by a pair of numbers.  The first
number indicates the number of the player who has the choice at the information
set.  The second number provides an identifying number for the
information set which is unique among that player's information sets.
Whenever possible, information sets are also
represented by vertical lines connecting the nodes that are members of
the same information set.\footnote{Eventually discuss somewhere
``lagged'' information sets.}  In this game, Player~1 observes which
card he has drawn prior to making his choice to ``Raise'' or ``Fold'';
therefore, the node following Chance's ``Red'' move is in a separate
information set, numbered (1,1), from the node following Chance's
``Black'' move, which is in information set (1,2).  Player~2, on the
other hand, does not observe Player~1's card, and so Player~2 has one
information set, numbered (2,1), with two member nodes connected by
a vertical line.

The analytical features of Gambit are located on the \textbf{Tools}
menu.  These are grouped into four submenus:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Subgames}, which contains items for the identification
and manipulation of subgames of the tree.  Since Player~2 does not
observe the card drawn by Player~1, this game has no proper subgames,
and so this menu will not be explored further in this introduction.
\item \textbf{Supports}, which contains items dealing with sets of
actions.  Of most immediate interest in this menu is the
\textbf{Undominated} item, which determines which actions are not
dominated by other actions.
\item \textbf{Equilibrium}, which contains items interfacing to the
various algorithms provided by Gambit to compute Nash equilibria of
the game.
\item \textbf{Normal form}, which contains items to compute normal
forms corresponding to the extensive form game.
\end{itemize}
In the following analysis, each of the latter three submenus will
be visited.

The analysis begins by searching for actions which might be dominated
by other actions at the same move.     

\chapter{Representation of Games in Gambit}

This chapter describes some notation and concepts from game theory
that are necessary to understand how Gambit represents and solves
games.  This chapter assumes a basic understanding of game
theory.  Definitions of the main terms are given intuitively in the
Glossary.

\section{The \index{extensive form}{Extensive Form}}\label{extformsec}

The extensive form is a detailed description of a sequence of decisions 
that must be made by a group of individuals. To illustrate the basic ideas,
 Figure~\ref{fig_samp1} 
shows how the extensive form of a simple 
\popref{two player poker game}{pokergloss} (from \cite{Mye:91} is represented
 in the Gambit GUI.  

\begin{figure}\label{fig_samp1}
%$$\image{1cm;0cm}{poker_ef}$$
\caption{Gambit Display of Extensive Form of
		a Simple Two Player Poker Game}\label{fig_samp1}
\end{figure}

It is only possible to do
this when nodes in the same information set are at the same level of
the tree.  When two member nodes of the same information set are not
at the same level, the information set is indicated by a ``lagged''
line, the end of which points in the direction of the next node, as
illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig_lag_iset}.

\begin{figure}\label{fig_lag_iset}
%$$\image{1cm;0cm}{lag_iset}$$
\caption{Gambit Display of information set when member nodes are at different levels}\label{fig_lag_iset}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Labeling}
There are three locations at which each node can be labeled, (above,
below, and to the right) and two at which each branch can be
\index{label}{labeled} (above and below.) You can choose which
information to display in the various positions by selecting the
information in the \helpref{Prefs->Legend}{displaymenu} menu.

\subsection{Numbering}\label{infosetnumbering}
In order  to associate strategy profiles in the 
normal form with the corresponding behavioral strategies in the extensive 
form, (and vice versa) you will need to understand how the branches and 
information sets are numbered.  The numbering of branches and information 
sets in the extensive form  is used to number pure strategies in the normal form.  

The \index{numbering}{numbering} of the \index{branches}{branches} is always
from top to bottom.  Thus, the highest branch at any node is always branch
1, the next branch is branch 2, etc. An \popref{action}{actiongloss} consists of 
the set of branches in an information set with the same branch number.  

In Gambit, each \popref{information set}{infosetgloss} has a unique 
information set ID, consisting of the player followed by the information 
set number.  Information sets for each player are numbered consecutively, 
in \popref{indexed traversal order}{indextravgloss}.  
The information set ID can be displayed at the decision nodes by selecting 
it in the \helpref{Prefs->Legend}{displaymenu} menu.  

\section{\index{strategies}{Strategies} and The \index{normal form}{Normal Form}}

A \index{pure strategy}{pure strategy} for a player is a function that 
associates with each of 
its information sets, a chosen action at that information set.  A pure 
strategy $n$-tuple is a vector of strategies, one for each player.  
The normal form for a game is a mapping which associates with each pure 
strategy $n$--tuple, an expected payoff to each player from 
playing that strategy. 

In the extensive form of the game in Gambit, the information sets for a 
player are numbered from \verb+1+ to \verb+J+, where \verb+J+ is the number of information 
sets that player \verb+i+ has.  We denote the pure strategy in which player \verb+i+ 
adopts strategy \verb+a+ in its first information set, \verb+b+ in its second, and 
\verb+c+ in its third \verb+abc+.  So if player \verb+i+ has three information sets, where 
the first two information sets contain three branches and the last contains 
two branches, then player \verb+i+ has a total of \verb+18+ strategies, 
and \verb+312+ indicates the strategy where the player chooses the third 
branch at its first information set, the first branch at its second 
information set, and the second branch at its third information set.  

In the extensive form of \helpref{Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}}{extformsec},
Player 1 has two information sets, each with two choices, so it has a
total of four strategies.  They are {\tt 11, 12, 21 } and {\tt 22}.
Player 2 has one information set, with two branches, so they are
labeled {\tt 1} and {\tt 2}.  The strategy {\tt 21} for player 1
represents the strategy of choosing FOLD with a Red card, and RAISE
with a Black card.
 
\subsection{Wildcard notation}
To represent a collection of strategies which differ only in the choice at
a particular information set, we use a ``\index{wildcard}{wildcard}'' 
notation.  For example,
if a player has three choices at its second information set, then the 
notation {\tt 3*2} is used to represent the collection of strategies, 
{\tt \{312, 322, 332\}}.  

The {\tt *} notation in Gambit serves the same purpose as the ``wildcard'' 
character in DOS file specifications.  To get a good appreciation for how 
the wildcard works, you should exit Gambit and WINDOWS, go to the root 
directory of your hard drive, and type \verb+del *.*[RET]+.

\subsection{\index{normal form}{Normal Form}}\label{normformsec}
The normal form of a game is a mapping which associates with 
each \popref{strategy profile}{stratprofgloss} a vector of
 payoffs for the players.  The normal form will thus be an $n$ dimensional 
matrix, with each cell containing a vector of length $n$.

Every extensive form game has an associated normal form.  The payoff for 
a given player under a particular strategy is computed as the sum of the 
\popref{realization probabilities}{realprobgloss} of each node times the 
value to the player of any outcome at that node.  The payoffs in the normal 
form are simply the expected payoff to each player from the given strategy
 profile.  

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{1cm;0cm}{poker_nf}$$
\caption{Gambit Graphics Display of Normal Form of
		Simple Two Player Poker Game}\label{fig_samp2}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig_samp2} gives the normal form for the extensive form game 
of poker illustrated in 
\helpref{Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}}{extformsec}. 

In the game of  \helpref{Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}}{extformsec}, with the 
strategy profile {\tt (12, 1)}, the realization probability of the terminal 
node on the path RED, RAISE, MEET, with a payoff of $(\$2.00, -\$2.00)$ 
is $1/2$, and the realization probability of terminal node on the path 
BLACK, FOLD, with a payoff of  $(-\$1.00, \$1.00)$ is $1/2$.    All other 
terminal nodes have realization probability of $0$ at this strategy profile.  
Taking expected values, this gives a payoff of  
$(\$0.50, -\$0.50)$, which is the entry in the normal form for this cell.  

\section{Types of Games}
\subsection{\index{Perfect Recall}{perfect recall}}\label{perfrecallsec}
A game of perfect recall is a game in which individuals do not forget what
they have known or done earlier in the game (see, eg., \cite{Mye:91}).  
This requires that
information sets must refine earlier information sets, and if there is
an information set, one of whose nodes follows a choice by the same player
at a previous information set, then all of the members of that information
set must follow the same choice.

Gambit does not enforce perfect recall on the extensive form games that
you build.  However, certain algorithms in Gambit only work on games of 
perfect recall.  
To find out if a game is perfect recall, you can go to the {\tt Inspect->GameInfo} 
menu.  Gambit will allow you to convert a game without perfect recall 
to normal form and solve for optimal 
mixed strategies.  The problem comes in converting the mixed strategy back
to a behavioral strategy.  If the game has perfect recall, then by Kuhn's 
theorem (see eg., \cite{vanDamme:1983}), any mixed strategy can be 
converted back to a behavioral strategy which is realization equivalent.   
If the game does not have perfect recall, this is not always possible.  
In this case, attempting to convert a mixed to a behavior strategy 
may yield unpredictable results which do not correspond to a valid 
behavior strategy.   

\subsection{Games of \index{Incomplete Information}{incomplete information}}\label{incinfsec}
Games of incomplete information are games in which different players have 
different beliefs about the underlying parameters (such as the utility 
functions, strategy sets, or number of players) of the game.  The standard 
way of treating such games is given in \cite{Harsanyi:1967}, where it
is shown that 
 such games are equivalent to games in which players have some common
prior distribution over the joint distribution of characteristics, and
 then individuals observe their own type, but not that of the other players 
in the game.  

Games of incomplete information can be modeled in Gambit by having an
initial chance move determine the distribution of types, and then
defining information sets so each individual observes only their own
type.

\chapter{Gambit GUI}

The Gambit GUI consists of two self-contained modules for
representing, displaying and manipulating games.  A game can be viewed
in either the extensive or normal forms.  Although independent, the
modules are integrated and it is possible to solve the game
in the normal form while viewing it in the extensive.  It is also
possible to go from the extensive form representation to the normal
form (but not vice versa at the present).  

When you first launch the Gambit GUI, you will see a screen as in
Figure~\ref{fig_gamgui}

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{gamgui}$$
\caption{Gambit GUI Introductory window}\label{fig_gamgui}
\end{figure}

You can select the module to be used in the File menu,
in one of two ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item Build a new game by selecting {\bf File->New} , and then
choosing either Extensive or Normal.  The toolbar can be used to speed
up frequently used commands.
\item Load an existing game by selecting {\bf File->Open}, and then
selecting a file that contains a previously saved game in either
extensive or normal form.
\end{itemize}

\section{File menu}

The {\bf File} menu is used to launch Gambit, by either loading a new
game or loading a previously saved game.

\begin{description}
\item[New:] Used to create a new normal or extensive form game. 
\begin{description}
\item[Normal:] You must input the number of players and the number of
strategies for each player, and then the \helpref{Normal Form 
GUI}{NFGUI} is started with a default normal for game of that
dimension.  The default game has no outcomes defined.  So all payoffs
are zero.
\item[Extensive:] You must select the number of players (default is
two), and then the \helpref{Extensive Form GUI}{EFGUI} is started with
a default game, which consists of the trivial game with only one node
(the root node) and no actions for the players.  The \helpref{Edit 
Menu}{efedit} in the extensive form GUI is then used to build up the
desired game.
\end{description}
\item[Open:] You will get a standard File Selector dialog box from
which you can either directly enter the name of the file to open, or
browse the directory system for the desired file.  Files containing
extensive form games are given the default extension of \verb+.efg+ in
Gambit, and files containing normal form games are given the default
extension \verb+.nfg+. If you select a normal form file, you will
bring up the \helpref{Normal Form GUI}{NFGUI} module.  If you select
an extensive form file, you will bring up the \helpref{Extensive Form
GUI}{EFGUI}.  When you save an extensive or normal form game in
Gambit, it is written in a standard format. Note that the file format
is forward, but not backward compatible: Previous versions of Gambit
may not be able to read files written by this version, but this
version should be able to read files written by previous versions of
Gambit.
\item[Quit:] Quits the Gambit GUI, and closes all child windows.  
\end{description}

\section{Data Types}\label{DataTypes}
Gambit can do computations in either floating point (float) or
exact arithmetic (rational).  Each number in the extensive an extensive 
or normal form game has an internal representation, or ``precision'' which is 
either floating point or rational.  

\begin{description}
\item[Float:] Floating point numbers are represented internally as
double precision floating point numbers, which on most machines
results in about 15 digits of accuracy.  The benefit of floating point
calculations is speed, since floating point numbers are designed to
fit in a fixed amount of storage, and arithmetic operations are coded
in hardware.  However, in some games, floating point calculations can
result in cumulation of roundoff errors that will lead to either
incorrect solutions or failure to find solutions that exist.
\item[Rational:] Rational numbers are represented internally as the
quotient of two arbitrary precision integers.  Doing calculations in
rationals will guarantee that the answer is exact for those algorithms
that support rational calculations.  However calculations in rationals
are slower than floating point calculations by one or two orders of
magnitude.  Currently the only algorithms supporting calculations in
rationals are the following two person algorithms: LpSolve, LcpSolve,
and EnumPure and EnumMixed.
\end{description}

The precision of a number is indicated in output by the way it is
printed.  If the number contains a decimal point, then its internal
representation is floating point.  If it has a \verb+/+ or is written
as an integer (with no decimal or \verb+/+), then it is a rational.
Similarly, when you enter a number, the internal representation is
determined by the way it is entered.

The data for a game can be a mixture of floating point and rational
numbers.  Any preliminary calculations in Gambit (such as elimination
of dominated strategies, conversion to normal form) are done in the
best precision that is supported by the data of the game.  For example
if a calculation involves a floating point and rational number, the
result will be floating point.

Some of the algorithms in Gambit support either floating point or
rational precision. The data for the game will be converted to that
precision, and the resulting solutions returned in that precision.  In
some cases, conversion from rational to floating point can lose
precision.  For example, the number $1/3$ does not have an exact
representation in floating point.  Thus, in cases where exact
solutions are required, it is good advice to enter all data in
rational precision.

\section{Dialogs}\label{GUIDialogs}

\subsection{Solutions Inspect}\label{SolutionInspect}

The solution inspection dialog displays information about Mixed or
Behavior Profiles that are either returned by algorithms or entered by 
the user.  The dialogs for the \helpref{Normal 
Form}{NormalSolutionInspect} and \helpref{Extensive 
Form}{ExtensiveSolutionInspect} solutions have many features in common,
and hence are described together.

The number of the solution that is currently selected will be
highlighted in the first column.  The currently selected solution will
also be displayed in the corresponding Extensive or Normal form
window.  To change the current solution (and thus change the display
in the corresponding Extensive or Normal form window), double click
(control-click in Linux) on the \# of the desired solution.  To
quickly browse the solutions, the {\em Update Solutions Dynamically} 
option may be used.  With this option on, the solution will change
automatically once the cursor moves to a different solution \#.
Double clicking on the first row deselects the current solution.

Note that if the entries in the extensive or normal form are changed,
then any solutions to the game are deleted, and any link to an
associated extensive form game (if it existed) is broken.

A variety of data dependent on the generating algorithm are available
for most Mixed or Behavior profiles. Not every category is relevant
for every profile.  If a certain data member is either not relevant or
not available, it will be displayed as {\tt ----}.  The display of
each data member is toggled in the Options dialog.  Note that the ID
data member is always displayed (it is an increasing (not necessarily
consecutive) index used to identify each solution)

Solutions may be deleted by pressing the {\bf Delete} button while the
solution is selected.  A solution may be edited by pressing the 
\helpref{Edit}{SolnAddEdit} button, or a new one created with the 
\helpref{Add}{SolnAddEdit} button.  Note that an edited or a newly
created solution will have {\em User} as the Creator and will have
most data members undefined.  Double clicking on any of the strategy
values will automatically call up the solution edit dialog.  To
facilitate working with a large number of solutions, the 
\helpref{Sort/Filter}{SolnSortFilt} functionality is available.

\subsubsection{Normal Form Solution Inspect}\label{NormalSolutionInspect}

This dialog displays information about Mixed Strategy Profiles that
are either returned by algorithms or entered by the user.  This dialog
is accessed through the {\bf View->Solution} selection in the normal
form menu.  

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{nfgsoln}$$
\caption{Normal Form Solution Inspect Window}\label{fig_nfgsoln}
\end{figure}

The probabilities of each staratgy are arranged with each player on a
separate row, and strategies in consecutive columns.  Each cell
consists of the strategy number (or name), followed by a colon, and
followed by the probability of that strategy.  If the {\em display
zero prob} option is not turned on, strategies with zero probability
will not be displayed.

The Extensive and Normal form Solution Inspect dialogs have many
features in common.  See the \helpref{Solution 
Inspect}{SolutionInspect} for a description of these common features.

If the underlying Normal Form game was generated from an Extensive
Form game, and if the link between the two is still valid, the {\em
Mixed->Behav} button will be enabled.  To project the solution to the
extensive form, and immediately display it there, press this button.

\subsubsection{Extensive Form Solution Inspect}\label{ExtensiveSolutionInspect}

This dialog displays information about Behavior Strategy Profiles that
are either returned by algorithms or entered by the user.  This dialog
is accessed through the {\bf Inspect->Solution} selection in the
extensive form menu.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{efgsoln}$$
\caption{Extensive Form Solution Inspect Window}\label{fig_efgsoln}
\end{figure}

The probability data for each information set is displayed on a
separate line.  The {\bf Iset} column gives the infoset ID in the form
of (player \#,iset \#).  The next cell contains a vector of
probabilities in which each entry corresponds to an action that can be
taken at that infoset.  If a player has more than one infoset,
additional lines are used.  This format is repeated for each player in
the game.

The Extensive and Normal form Solution Inspect dialogs have many
features in common.  See the \helpref{Solution 
Inspect}{SolutionInspect} for a description of these common features.

A useful feature when navigating large extensive form games is {\em 
Hilight Infosets}.  It is toggled on or off from the EF window {\bf 
Inspect->Infosets}.  When enabled, double clicking on an infoset in
the EF window will hilight the corresponding infoset in the Solution
inspect window.  Double clicking on an infoset (Iset column) in the
Solution inspection window will hilight the corresponding infoset in
the EF window.

For extensive form games, an additional level of solution inspection
is provided by the Node Inspect window.  The window may be turned
on/off through the {\bf Inspect->Info} menu. When enabled, a small
window displays solution information pertaining to the cursor node.
The window can be dismissed by turning the option off in the same
menu.

\normalbox{For configuration and output features of this dialog see
the generic \helprefn{Table Window}{TableWindow} description.}

\subsection{Sorting and Filtering Solutions}\label{SolnSortFilt}
\begin{figure}
%$$\image{1cm;0cm}{sortfilt}$$
\caption{Sort/Filter Dialog Box}\label{fig_nfgsortfilt}
\end{figure}

To facilitate work with a large number of solutions, Gambit implements
solution sorting and filtering.  These features are accessed by the
{\bf Sort/Filter} button in the solution inspect window.  Clicking an
item in the {\bf Sort By} box will sort the solutions by their values
on that item.  [Double clicking on the column heading in the first row
of the Solution Inspect window will also sort the solutions by the
corresponding column].  Deselecting an item in the {\bf Filter By} box
will cause the solutions that satisfy that item not to be displayed.
(I.e. to filter out all NASH equilibria, deselect the {\bf Yes} item
in the {\bf Nash} listbox; to display just solutions generated by the
{\bf QRE} algorithm, deselect all items except for QRE in the {\bf 
Creator} listbox.  Note that the filter option may lead to some
confusion if newly generated solutions are automatically filtered out.

\subsection{Adding and Editing Solutions}\label{SolnAddEdit}
\begin{figure}
%$$\image{1cm;0cm}{editmix}$$
\caption{Edit Mixed Solution Dialog Box}\label{fig_nfgsortfilt}
\end{figure}

Gambit allows the user to add a new mixed or behavior profile or edit
an existing solution for the purpose of investigating its properties.
Note that profiles that are added or edited do not have to have
probabilities that add to one.

These features are accessed via the {\bf Add} and {\bf Edit} buttons
in the solution inspect window.  The probabilities for each strategy
can be edited by moving the cursor to the appropriate cell in the Edit
Mixed Solution dialog box.  Selecting {\tt OK} will cause the profile
to be added to the list of solutions in the Solution Inspect window.
Any profile that is added or edited will appear in the Solution
Inspect Window with a creator of {\tt User}.  When a solution is
edited, typically its properties will change.

\subsection{Output Media Dialog}\label{OutputMedia}\label{outputsec}

Many of the windows in Gambit have a menu item which can be 
selected to generate output to a printer or a file.  When you select this 
option, you will get a dialog box which will ask the medium to which the 
output is to be generated.  

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{output}$$
\caption{Output Media dialog}\label{fig_outputmedia}
\end{figure}

You can select one of the following choices:

\begin{description}
\item[Printer:] This will send the output directly to your printer. 
\item[Postscript:] Writes a postscript file, which can be viewed by a 
postscript viewer (such as ghostscript) sent to a printer 
supporting postscript.  
\item[Clipboard:] Writes to clipboard
\item[MetaFile:] Writes to metafile.  
\item[PrintPreview:]  This will generate display on your screen which will 
show the positioning of the output on the page.   
\end{description}

In some cases, there will be a toggle \verb+fit to page+.  If you
select this option, then the entire output of the window will be
displayed, even if it is not all visible on the your screen.  If you
do not select this option, then only the portion that is visible on
your screen is output.

\subsection{Standard Solution Dialog}\label{StandardSolution}

This dialog uses standard settings to compute various types of
equilibria. For more information on the settings used, see the section
on \helpref{NFG Standard Solutions}{NFGStandardSolutions} for the
normal form or \helpref{EFG Standard Solutions}{EFGStandardSolutions} 
for the extensive form.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{stdsolnf}$$
\caption{Standard Solution dialog for normal form
games}\label{fig_standardsolnf}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{stdsolef}$$
\caption{Standard Solution dialog for extensive form
games}\label{fig_standardsolef}
\end{figure}

Select one choice in each box.  Not all combinations are available for
all games, in which case, some choices will be greyed out.  For
example Rational computations are only supported on certain algorithms
on two person games, Perfect equilibria can only be computed for two
person games.

\subsection{Change Payoffs Dialog}\label{ChangePayoff}

This dialog used to enter or edit the payoffs of an outcome in the
extensive or normal form. It is accessible through the {\bf 
Edit->Outcome->New} or {\bf Edit->Outcome->Payoffs} menu selections in
either the Normal or Extensive Form GUI. It can also be accessed by
double clicking on either a cell of the normal form, or an outcome in
the extensive form. 

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{chngpay}$$
\caption{Change Payoffs dialog}\label{fig_changepay}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Select Outcome Dialog}\label{SelectOutcome}

This dialog used to select an outcome in either the extensive or
normal form. It is accessible through the {\bf Edit->Outcome->Delete} or 
{\bf Edit->Outcome->Attach} menu selections in either the Normal or
Extensive Form GUI. 

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{slctout}$$
\caption{Select Outcome dialog}\label{fig_selectout}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Draw Options Dialog}\label{DrawOptions}

This dialog used to select parameters affecting the layot of the game
tree.  It is accessible through the {\bf Prefs->Display->Layout} menu
selection in either the Extensive Form GUI.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{drawopts}$$
\caption{Draw Options dialog}\label{fig_drawopts}
\end{figure}

All lengths are in pixels.  The {\bf Show Infoset Lines} choicebox is used
to select a mode for display of information sets on the extensive
form.  {\bf None} means no lines are drawn connecting members of
information sets.  {\bf Same Level} means only members of an
information set at the same level of the tree are connected with
lines.  {\bf All Levels} means that all nodes are connected, using
lagged lines.  See Figure~\ref{fig_lag_iset} in the \helpref{Extensive
Form}{extformsec} section for an illustration.

\subsection{Inspect Node Dialog}\label{InspectNode}

This dialog used to display solution information about the currently
selected node in an extensive form game.  The information is
continually updated as the game is navigated.  This dialog is
accessible through the {\bf Inspect->Cursor} menu item.  

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{inspnode}$$
\caption{Inspect Node dialog}\label{fig_inspectnode}
\end{figure}

The information to display can be toggled via the {\bf Display} menu
item.

\subsection{Zoom Window}\label{ZoomWindow}

The zoom window is used to provide a magnified window into the
selected node of the extensive form game.  This dialog is accessible
through the {\bf Inspect->ZoomWindow} menu item. 

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{zoomwin}$$
\caption{Zoom Window display}\label{fig_zoomwin}
\end{figure}

The display is centered around the currently selected node in an
extensive form game.  The magnification is controlled by the {\tt +}
and {\tt -} toolbar buttons on the Extensive Form display.  The
information in this dialog is continually updated as the game is
navigated.

\subsection{Accelerators Dialog}\label{AcceleratorSec}

Many frequently executed commands are much more efficiently entered
through the keyboard than by using a mouse.  To speed up the use of
the GUI for an experienced user, most of the 'mouseable' commands can
also be done by entering a combination of keys on the keyboard.  Both
the normal and the extensive forms possess this functionality.  The
accelerator key setting is accessed through the {\bf Prefs->Accel} 
menu item.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{accel}$$
\caption{Accelerators dialog}\label{fig_accel}
\end{figure}

In this dialog, the event to be changed or defined is first selected
from the choicebox on the left.  If this event is associated with a
key combination already, the key will be displayed in the box on the
left, otherwise, the entries in the box will be blank.  A new key
combo can be assigned by selecting the combo in the box and pressing 
{\bf Set}.  The association can be removed by selecting {\bf None}.

Gambit comes with a pre-defined set of accelerator keys described in
the corresponding \helpref{extensive}{ExtFormDefAccl} and
\helpref{normal}{NormFormDefAccl} sections.  Any of these default
command-key associations can be edited or removed.  

\subsection{Dominance Elimination Dialog}\label{UnDominated}

This dialog is used to compute undominated strategies for a normal or
extensive form games, and return a new support consisting of
undominated strategies.  It is accessed via the {\bf 
Supports->UnDominated} menu item.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{elimdomd}$$
\caption{Dominance elimination dialog}\label{fig_elimdomd}
\end{figure}

The following parameters can be selected:

\begin{description}
\item[Eliminate Iteratively:] Select this checkbox to iteratively
eliminate dominated strategies. The result will be a nested sequence
of supports, with the last one consisting of strategies that are
undominated in the final support.
\item[Type:] You can select the type of domination to use: weak or
strong domination.  
\item[Method:] You can select whether to eliminate only strategies
that are dominated by a single (pure) strategy or by a combination of
some strategies (mixed).  Elimination by mixed strategies is only
available for normal form games.  For extensive form games this
choicebox will also allow selection of {\bf Conditional} domination,
which means that dominance computations are done using payoffs that
are conditional on reaching the information set of the strategy,
rather than on the payoff at the root node.
\item[Precision:] This option is only available for mixed elimination,
and determines whether the resulting computations are done in Rational
or Floating point.  
\item[Players:] You may select which players to eliminate dominated
strategies for. The default is all players, meaning that dominated
strategies for each player are computed over the initial support, and
then eliminated simultaneously to create the new support.
\end{description}

\subsection{Creating and Editing Supports}\label{EditSupport}

This dialog is used to create a new support or edit an existing
support.  It is accessed through the {\bf Supports->New} or {\bf
Supports->Edit} menu item.  Only the normal form version is shown, as
the functionality for the extensive form is similar.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{support}$$
\caption{Support Selection dialog}\label{fig_support}
\end{figure}

The hilighted strategies are those that are included in the support.
A new support starts with the default of the {\em full support},
editing a support starts with the selected support as the default.  To
deselect a player's strategy, click on it in the appropriate listbox.
The strategy will no longer be hilighted.  When the dialog is
dismissed, the newly created support will be added to the support
list.

\subsection{Add Move Dialog}\label{AddMove}

This dialog is used to add a move to the extensive form game, and is
accessed through the {\bf Edit->Node->AddMove} or {\bf 
Edit->Node->InsertMove} menu items in the extensive form GUI.  

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{addmove}$$
\caption{Add Move dialog}\label{fig_addmove}
\end{figure}

Select the player to be in control of the move by clicking on a player
in the Player choicebox.  The player can be either chance or an
existing player, or a "New Player."  If New Player is chosen, a new
player will be created and given a default name "Player \#."  If this
node is to belong to an existing information set, choose the desired
infoset from the Infoset choicebox.  If a new information set is to be
created, just enter the number of branches desired.  If the node
created was a CHANCE node, you will be prompted for the
probabilities associated with each branch.

\subsection{Legends Dialog}\label{Legends}

This dialog is accessed through the {\bf Prefs->Legends} menu item, or
by double clicking (or Ctrl-RightClick) the right mouse button on the
extensive form display.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{legend}$$
\caption{Legend dialog}\label{fig_legend}
\end{figure}

There are two positions where information can be displayed for each
branch (above and below.)  In each of these positions, you can select
to display information about the game tree (such as branch numbers or
action names), or information about the currently selected solution
(such as action probabilities or action values).  Similarly, there are
three positions at which information can be displayed for a node
(above, below, and to the right).  In the positions above and below
the node, you can select to display information about the game tree
(such as infoset name or ID), or information about the currently
selected solution (such as realization probabilities, node values,
belief probabilities). The position to the right of the node is
reserved for information relating to outcomes, and here you can select
to display the outcome name or outcome vector.

\subsection{Table Window}\label{TableWindow}
The table window is used several places in Gambit.  It offers a large
number of possible configuration options.  Gambit will attempt to
choose the most suitable settings for each use, but Since Gambit runs
on many different platforms, the default settings may not be suitable
for your platform.  The following settings can be set:

\begin{description}
\item[Font:] Selects the font to be used for the Labels and/or Data in
the display.
\item[Column Width:] The program will usually select the cell width to
fit the widest item in the table.  However, if an unusually long name
is used, this width may be insufficient.  The scrollbar controls the
width of the cell, measured either in character width's or pixels.
Character based sizing is default and is recommended.  If for some
reason more precise dimensioning is desired, or if the cell width is
not to change with the font size, the {\em char} checkbox should be
unchecked.  The width can be changed for a single column by choosing
the desired column \# in the {\em Col} choicebox or for all the
columns by choosing All in the choicebox (default).
\item[Show Labels:] It is possible to turn off the row and column
labels by unchecking their corresponding checkboxes.  However, this is
not recommended since frequently important information is contained in
those labels.
\item[Color Text:] Some instances of the table window employ colored
text for clearer presentation of the data (i.e. the normal form,
solution inspection windows).  The only reason to turn this feature
off is to speed up display on very slow computer or over very slow
networks.
\item[Decimal Places:] The number of digits displayed after the
decimal point in all floating point numbers is controlled by this
slider.  Note that this setting does not in any way effect the actual
precision of the calculations.
\end{description}

All of these features can be saved to a defaults file (Gambit.ini).  They
will be taken into account the next time the table window is used, as long
as they are not overridden by the program.

\section{Mathematical Errors}
Under certain conditions some of the numerical algorithms may attempt to
execute an invalid mathematical operation.  Possible examples include
taking a logarithm of 0, attempting to exponentiate a very large number, and
other overflow or domain violation errors.  When this condition is detected,
the user is presented with an option to:

\begin{description}
\item[Continue] This is the default option.  The user acknowledges the
error and the algorithm continues.
\item[Ignore] The user acknowledges the error and all future errors
are ignored (no notification).
\item[Quit] The user instructs the program to terminate.
\end{description}

Note that if either of the first two options is selected, the results 
returned by the algorithm may be invalid.

\chapter{Normal Form GUI}\label{NFGUI}

The following is an example of the Normal form display of the sample
poker game.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{0cm;0cm}{nfg}$$
\caption{A 2 player normal form}\label{fig_nfg}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{6cm;2cm}{nfgtools}$$
\caption{NF GUI toolbar}\label{fig_nfgtools}
\end{figure}

\section{Normal Form Display}

In the normal form representation, the game is viewed as a
2-dimensional window into an N-dimensional matrix.  Each 2D window
shows a table of payoffs for each player as a function of the
strategies for two of the players, holding the strategies of all of
the other players (if there are any) fixed.  Note that this
organization requires each game to have at least two players.  Each
cell contains the payoff vector with one entry per player for the
strategy profile determined by this cell.  The profile itself is set
by using a combination of settings for the row and column players plus
the strategy settings for the rest of the players.  

The payoff vector can be edited by double-clicking on the cell and
entering new values in the dialog. To enter an entire game matrix, an
accelerator key may be useful.  Assuming the default accelerators are
used, pressing the {\tt TAB} key will move the cursor to the next cell
of the normal form, and call up the payoff edit dialog. So an entire
matrix can be entered by first double clicking on the first (upper
left) cell, editing the entries (using tab to advance to successive
entries), hitting return, then successively pressing tab, editing the
entries and pressing return to enter the remaining cells of the
matirix.

\subsection{Row and Column Players} The row and column player choice boxes
determine which players' strategies get displayed on the horizontal and
vertical axis of the matrix.  You can select a new player by clicking on the 
arrow at the right of the box, and selecting a new player from the 
list of players in the game.  The dimensions of the matrix are
determined by the number of strategies for the row and column players.
Note that it is meaningless to select the same player for both the row and
the column.  If the game has more than two players, a warning will be
issued and no action will be taken.  In the case of a two player game, the
row and the column players will be switched.

\subsection{Strategy Profile}
The array of choice boxes labeled "Profile" at all times reflects the
strategies picked by each player to achieve the payoffs shown in the
highlighted cell.  The nth choice box can contain a value from 1 to the
total number of strategies the nth player has.  When one of the choice
boxes is changed, one of two things can happen:

\begin{enumerate}
\item If the choice box number is not equal to either the row or
the column player, the entire matrix will be updated with new values to
reflect the new 2D view into the matrix.
\item If the choice box number was either the row or the column player,
the highlighted cell will move to reflect the new strategy.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Normal Form Menu}

\subsection{File Menu (nfg)}\label{nffile}

Basic input/output operations are handled in this menu item.  

\begin{description}
\item[Save:] Saves the normal form game to a file.  Normal form games
are written in a standard format and use the extension {\tt .nfg}.
Note that the file format is forward, but not backward compatible:
Previous versions of Gambit may not be able to read files written by
this version, but this version should be able to read files written by
previous versions of Gambit.
\item[Output:] Outputs the normal form game.  The \helpref{Output Media}{outputmedia} dialog is used to select where to send the output. 
\item[Close:] Closes the normal form gui window, along with all child windows that depend on it.  
\end{description}

\subsection{Edit Menu (nfg)}\label{nfedit}

This menu item is used to edit the normal form game.  

\begin{description}
\item[Label:] Change or enter a label for the normal form game. This
label is saved along with the game if it is saved into a {\tt .nfg}
file, and appears in the window banner to identify the game that has
been loaded.
\item[Players:] Edit the names assigned to the players. 
\item[Strategies:] Assign labels to strategies for each player in the game.   
\item[Outcomes:] Create, edit and delete outcomes
\begin{description}
\item[New:] Creates a new outcome for the game, and brings up the 
\helpref{Change Payoff}{ChangePayoff} dialog to edit the payoffs for
the outcome.  Note that outcomes need not be attached to any cell.
Use the {\bf attach} item in this sub menu to attach the outcome to a
cell in the game. 
\item[Delete:] Deletes the selected outcome.  The \helpref{Select
Outcome}{SelectOutcome} dialog is used to select the outcome to
delete.
\item[Attach:] Brings up the \helpref{Select Outcome}{SelectOutcome} 
dialog to select an outcome to attach to the hilighted cell of the
normal form.
\item[Detach:] Detaches the outcome from the highlighted cell of the
normal form, resulting in no outcome attached to the cell. 
\item[Payoffs:] Edit the payoffs of the outcome attached to the
highlighted cell of the normal form. The \helpref{Change
Payoff}{ChangePayoff} dialog is used to edit the payoffs.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{Supports Menu (nfg)}\label{nfsupports}

Several menu items are available for manipulating Normal form supports.  

\begin{description}
\item[Undominated:] Create new supports via elimination of dominated
strategies.  This brings up the \helpref{dominance
elimination}{UnDominated} dialog for selection of the type of
dominance elimination to use.
\item[New:] Used to create a new support for the normal form game.
This brings up the \helpref{Edit Support}{EditSupport} dialog to select
the strategies for each player.  For a detailed explanation of a {\em
Support} see the section on \helpref{supports}{supportsec} in the
theory section.
\item[Edit:] Edit the current support to add or remove strategies from
it. The \helpref{Edit Support}{EditSupport} dialog is used.  
\item[Delete:] Delete a support from the list of supports.   
\item[Select:] Select a support from the list as the current support.  
\end{description}

\subsection{Solve Menu (nfg)}\label{nfsolve}

This menu item provides access to the algorithms for solving the game. 

\begin{description}
\item[Standard:] Uses standard settings to compute various types of
equilibria on the game.  The \helpref{Standard 
Solution}{StandardSolution} dialog is used to select the type of
equilibrium to compute.  
\item[Custom:] Allows the user to select a particular algorithm and
customize the settings for that algorithm.  Only a user familiar with
the algorithms used by Gambit should use the custom settings, since
the program makes no attempt to check for the validity of some of the
parameters.  For a detailed discussion of the 
\helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} see the appropriate sections.

Not all algorithms are applicable to all games.  If an algorithm is
not available for the currently loaded normal form, it will be grayed
out in the menu.  When a custom algorithm is selected, a customized 
\helpref{Algorithm Parameters}{NFGCustomSolutions} diaolg will be
displayed to allow for selection of parameters for the algorithm.

\begin{description}
\item[EnumPure:] Finds all pure strategy equilibria of the game via 
\helpref{Enumeration}{EnumPure}.
\item[EnumMixed:] Enumerates all mixed strategy equilibria of the
game via the \helpref{EnumMixed}{EnumMixed} algorithm. Only valid for two
person games.
\item[Lcp:] Uses the Lemke-Howson, or \helpref{Linear
Complementarity}{Lcp} method fto find all accessible Nash
equilibria. Only valid for two person games.
\item[Lp:] Uses the \helpref{Linear programming}{Lp} method.  Only
valid for two person zero sum games.
\item[Liapunov:] \helpref{Liapunov}{Liap} method.  
\item[Simpdiv:] \helpref{Simplicial subdivision}{SimpDiv}. 
\item[Polenum:] \helpref{Polenum}{Polenum} method.  
\item[Qre:] Finds equilibria by Following a branch of the \helpref{Quantal
Response Equilibrium}{QRE} correspondence.
\item[QreGrid:] Computation of full QRE correspondence via a 
\helpref{grid search}{QreAll} (only feasible for very small games).
\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{View Menu (nfg)}\label{nfinspectsec}
The normal form {\bf View} menu item allows selection of what
information to display on the normal form.  The possible selection are 

\begin{description}
\item[Solutions:]  Selecting this menu item brings up the normal form 
\helpref{Solutions Inspect}{NormalSolutionInspect} dialog if
there are any solutions in the curent solution list.
\item[Dominance:]  A toggle to display dominance information about
strategies in the normal form. When on, dominance information for each
strategy is indicated along the border of the normal form.  An {\tt N} 
means that the strategy is not dominated, {\tt W} means that it is
weakly dominated, and {\tt S} means it is strongly
dominated.  Computations are with respect to the currently displayed
support.
\item[Probabilities:]  A toggle to display the strategy probabilities
for the currently selected solution.  An extra row and column are
added to the matrix to show the calculated probability of row and
column players choosing the respective strategies.  If there are more
than two players, the number in the lower right cell is the
probability of players other than row and column choosing their
strategies to achieve this profile.
\item[Value:]  A toggle to display for each strategy the expected 
payoff for that strategy under the current solution.  
\item[Outcomes:] Toggle to select what to display in the cells of the normal form matrix.  When on, the outcome name is displayed.  When off, the payoff vector is displayed.  
\item[GameInfo:] Displays information about the game -- the number
of players, whether or not it is constant sum, and indicates if the
game has been edited since loading.
\end{description}

\subsection{Prefs Menu (nfg)}
The {\bf Prefs} menu item is used to change various display features
of the normal form matrix:  

\begin{description}
\item[Display:] Used to change the number of decimal places that are displayed and the column width of the cells in the normal form.  
\item[Font:] Brings up a dialog to select the size and style of the font used to display data in the normal form.  
\item[Colors:] Used to select colors assigned to each player.
\item[Accels:] Accelerator keys can be defined to serve as
shortcuts for frequently used commands.  The  \helpref{Accelerator
Keys}{AcceleratorSec} dialog is used to define accelerator keys. 
\item[Save:] Saves the current selections as the default.  Unless
saved, the selections in this menu item will return to the original
values after the normal form is dismissed.
\item[Load:] Loads the current default selections for parameter
selections set in this section.
\end{description}

\section{Normal Form Solutions}\label{NormalFormSolutions}
A large number of different \helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} 
are available for solving normal form games.  In order to cater to
experienced users familiar with the properties of individual
algorithms, many relevant parameters can be edited through a variety
of solution related dialog boxes.  To allow simpler access to the
basic features provided by the algorithms, a set of commonly used {\em
standard} solution types has been included with Gambit.  The user need
only determine the general features of the desired equilibria and
Gambit will take care of all the details.

The standard solution settings are accessed via the {\bf 
Solve->Standard} menu, or pressing the
\begin{figure}
%\image{.5cm;.5cm}{solvtool}
\end{figure}
 button on the toolbar.

If the current game was generated from an extensive form game, and if no
changes have been made to either game, there will exist a link between the
two forms.  In this case, the {\em Extensive form} checkbox will be
enabled.  Checking this box will cause all generated solutions (if
applicable to the solution type) to be converted back into behavior
profiles and projected back to the extensive form window.  The solutions
can then be examined in the extensive form display.

\subsection{NFG Standard Solutions}\label{NFGStandardSolutions}

The standard solutions dialog is accessed via the {\bf Solve->Standard} 
menu.  The particular settings are then picked in the dialog box.  You
can select what kind of an equilibrium to compute (Nash or Perfect),
and a maximum number of solutions to compute.  When you select a
standard solution setting, it automatically sets various parameters
that control the solution computation.  These parameters include
whether and how to iteratively eliminate dominated strategies, which
algorithm to use for the computation, and the maximum number of
solutions to search for before finishing the computation.  The
settings for each of the standard solutions are given in the following
table:

\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|l|}
\row{Type & Number & Game Type & UnDominated & Algorithm & Notes}
\hline
\row{Nash & One    & 2 person constant sum &Weak & LP-1 & }
\row{     &        & 2 person general  sum &Weak & LCP-1& }
\row{     &        & n person              &Weak & SimpDiv-1 & }
\hline
\row{Nash & Two    & 2 person              &Strong & EnumMixed-2 & }
\row{     &        & n person              &Strong & Liap-2      & }
\hline
\row{Nash & All    & 2 person              &Strong & EnumMixed-0 &  }
\row{     &        & n person              &Strong & PolEnum-0      &  }
\hline
\hline
\row{Perfect & One    & 2 person           &Weak & LCP-1    & }
\row{     &           & n person              &       &     &Not implemented  }
\hline
\row{Perfect & Two    & 2 person              &Weak & EnumMixed-2 & }
\row{     &           & n person              &       &     & Not implemented }
\hline
\row{Perfect & All    & 2 person              &Weak & EnumMixed-0 & }
\row{     &           & n person              &       &     & Not implemented}
\hline
\end{tabular}

In the entry for the algorithm for the above table, after the algorithm name is 
indicated the maximum number of solutions 
to be found.  If this number is 0, the algorithm will only terminate when it has found 
all solutions.  For algorithms which are not guaranteed to find all solutions (such 
as Liap), the 
algorithm will enter an infinite loop, and continue to search until the computation is 
aborted by the user. 
 
To have individual control over each any of the parameters mentioned above, see
the \helpref{Custom Solutions}{NFGCustomSolutions} section.

\subsection{NFG Custom Solutions}\label{NFGCustomSolutions}
Only a user familiar with the algorithms should use the custom
settings since the program makes no attempt to check for the validity
of some of the parameters.  For a detailed discussion of the 
\helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} see the appropriate sections.

A custom algorithm is selected in the {\bf Solve->Custom} submenu.
Each solution algorithm is controlled by two groups of settings, both
of which are set on the dialog box for the particular algorithm.
\begin{description}
\item[Dominance elimination:] Prior to running the algorithm,
dominated strategies may be eliminated, thus speeding up the
consequent calculations.  The type of dominace elimination is
controlled by three radioboxes at the top the dialog box for the
algorithm.
\begin{description}
\item[Depth:] Determines whether and how much dominance
elimination is to be done.  {\bf None} indicates no dominance
elimination, {\bf Once} selects a single step of elimination, and {\bf 
Iterative} selects iterative elimination of dominated strategies.
\item[Type:] Determines whether to use {\bf weak} or {\bf strong}
domination.
\item[Method:] Determines whether to eliminate strategies that are
dominated only by pure strategies or whether to also eliminate
strategies dominated by mixed strategies.  Elimination by pure
strategies is faster, but may not find all dominated strategies, as it
is possible that strategies that are not dominated by any pure
strategy may be dominated by a mixed strategy.
\end{description}
\item[Algorithm parameters:] The remainder of the dialog box is used
for setting parameters that are specific to the algorithm.  These
parameters will differ from algorithm to algorithm.  The settings for
the particular algorithm are described in the 
\helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} section.
\end{description}

Note that some algorithms require a starting point.  Depending on the
options selected in the custom parameters dialog for these algorithms,
a starting point dialog may pop up before the algorithm is run.  The
default (centroid) is usually the best place to start.  Double
clicking on the first profile in the window and pressing {\tt Ok} will
select the default and allow the algorithm to continue. Advanced users
may choose to enter a different starting point, such as profiles
resulting from the use of other algorithms.

\section{Default Accelerator Keys}\label{NormFormDefAccl}
To speed up some of the more commonly used commands in the GUI, a set of 
{\em accelerator keys} may be defined.  Once defined, a combination of keys
can be used to activate most of the menus and buttons.  Accelerator key
definitions are accessed through the Prefs->Accels menu.  Accelerator key
definitions are saved in the main Gambit defaults file (gambit.ini).  Gambit
is distributed with the following keys defined.
\begin{description}
\item[TAB:] The TAB key is defined to be {\bf EditNextPayoff} event, and 
can be used to rapidly enter or modify a normal form.  Pressing TAB
will automatically move the cursor to the next cell in the normal
form, and display a dialog box to edit the entries.  Thus the entire
game can be entered by repeatedly pressing TAB and entering the values
-- no mouse operations are required.
\item[RETURN:] The RETURN key is defined as teh {\bf EditPayoff}
event.  Hitting RETURn will bring up a dialog box to enter or edit the
payoff of the outcome attached to the selected cell of the normal
form.
\end{description}

\chapter{Extensive Form GUI}\label{EFGUI}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

In the extensive form, the game is represented as a topological tree.  The 
section on representation of the \helpref{Extensive Form}{extformsec} 
has a more detailed explanation of this form.
Compared to the Normal Form, the Extensive Form interface is much richer
and thus considerably more complex.  A major portion of the functionality
is devoted to the tree building.  Another set of functions deals with
customizing the display, and yet another set of functions takes care of
the solutions and their display.  

\section{Extensive Form Display}

\subsection{Navigating the Extensive Form}
The cursor is indicated on the display of the normal form by a 
solid or flashing dark line above 
one of the nodes or by a dark triangle around a subgame icon. 
The cursor position is used by many of the tree building functions.  
You can move the cursor around the extensive form game 
either by use of the arrow keys or by using the mouse.  

When the extensive form 
game becomes large, only a window into the extensive form game is displayed.  
As you move the cursor around the game tree, the window will redraw 
the game tree when necessary to keep the cursor visible. 

For large games, the whole game tree will not be visible at one time.  If you 
want to see more of the game tree, you can change the magnification by 
using the {\tt Prefs->Zoom} menu.  You can also use the \verb+-+ and 
\verb&+& keys to change the magnification by constant increments. When 
editing a large game, if the magnification level is too small, you may 
not be able to read the textual information displayed on the game tree.  You 
can use the {\em Zoom Window}, which can be enabled in the 
{\tt Inspect->ZoomWindow} menu to get a magnified view of the tree 
at the cursor location.  

\subsection{Drag and Drop}\label{DragAndDrop}
Many of the editing functions can be executed by drag-and-dropping
with the mouse.  

\begin{figure}
%\image{0cm;0cm}{dragdrop}
\caption{Sample Drag n' Drop operations}
\end{figure}

Most of the labeling information can be quickly changed by
double-clicking at the location on the tree of the label and entering
the data in the dialog that pops up.  Similarly, double clicking on
the location of an outcome will bring up the payoff dialog for
outcomes.

\section{Extensive Form Menu}

\subsection{File Menu (efg)}\label{effile}

Basic input/output operations are handled in this menu item.  

\begin{description}
\item[Save:] Saves the extensive form game to a file.  Extensive form
games are written in a standard format and use the extension {\tt 
.efg}. Note that the file format is forward, but not backward compatible:
Previous versions of Gambit may not be able to read files written by
this version, but this version should be able to read files written by
previous versions of Gambit.
\item[Output:] Outputs the extensive form game.  The \helpref{Output
Media}{outputmedia} dialog is used to select where to send the output.
\item[Close:] Closes the extensive form gui window, along with all
child windows that depend on it.
\end{description}

\subsection{Edit Menu (efg)}\label{efedit}
This menu item is used to build or modify the extensive form game.
This section assumes a working knowledge of the conventions used in
the Gambit extensive form display (discussed in the \helpref{Extensive
Form}{extformsec} section).  Note that any structural changes to the
tree structure will invalidate all existing solutions.  The solutions
list will be cleared and solutions removed.

The {\bf Edit} menu may also be called up by clicking the {\em right}
mouse button causing the menu to pop up at the current mouse cursor
position.

\begin{figure}
%\image{0cm;0cm}{popup}
\caption{Popup Edit menu}
\end{figure}

In addition, many of the operations in this menu can be implemented by 
\helpref{drag and drop}{DragAndDrop} operations, as indicated in the
descriptions below.  

\begin{description}
\item[Node:]
\begin{description}
\item[Add Move:] The selected node is put into an information set
using the \helpref{Add Move}{AddMove} dialog.  The result is that the
node becomes a decision node, with number of branches equal to the
number of actions in the information set.  New child nodes are created
as successor nodes to the actions in the information set.  Only valid
at terminal nodes.  
\item[Delete Move:] Deletes the move at the cursor node from the
extensive form game.  The subtree rooted at one of the actions takes
the place of the deleted node in the tree.  You will be prompted to
select a branch to keep.  All other subtrees descending from the
cursor node are deleted.  Deleting a move does not delete
the information set which the corresponding node was in.
\item[Insert Move:] This is analogous to \helpref{Add Move}{AddMove},
except that it can be used at a non terminal node.  The move is
inserted into the tree at that point, and the portion of the tree that
was previously at that node is moved to the first child of the
inserted node.
\item[Label:] Each node can have a label associated with it.  This
function allows the entering or modification of this label.  The
display of these labels is controlled in the 
\helpref{Legends}{Legends} Dialog.
\item[Set Mark:] The GUI allows you to mark (memorize) one node for
later use.  The marked node is required in some tree operations.  The
marked node is indicated by a small circular token on the game tree.
Note that drag-and-drop mouse operations make the node-mark
unnecessary.
\item[Goto Mark:]  Moves the cursor to the mark.  This can be useful in a 
very large game to quickly move from one part of the game to another. 
\end{description}
\item[Actions:]
\begin{description}
\item[Delete:] Select the action to be deleted from the dialog box.
The selected action will be removed from all information sets that it
belongs to.  All descendants of the nodes at this branches are also
removed.

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} Place the cursor on top of a
branch corresponding to the action to be deleted while pressing the
shift key.  The cursor will change to a scissors token.  Pressing the
mouse button while the scissors are displayed will delete the action
from the tree.
\item[Insert:] A new action is inserted after the action that is
selected from the dialog box.  A branch will be added to every node
that belongs to the same information set as the selected node.

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} Place the cursor at the juncture
of the branch lines with the end of the node line (the point where the
action branches begin).  Press the mouse button and drag it to the
right.  A new branch will appear as a "rubber band," which you can
drag to a location where you want the new action to appear.
\item[Append:] Appends a new action as the last action at the selected
information set.
\item[Label:] Each action in an infoset can have a label.  This allows
the setting or changing of this label.
\item[Probabilities:] Allows the explicit setting of each action
probability.  Only valid when the cursor is on a CHANCE node.
\end{description}

\item[Infoset:]
\begin{description}
\item[Merge:] Merges the information set at the cursor into the
information set at the mark.  Both information sets must have the same
number of actions.  Note that you can not merge infosets across
different subgames (unmark subgames first).

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} The merge operation can be
achieved by clicking on an infoset marker (small circle) at the base
of a node and dragging it to the infoset marker of the target node.
\item[Break:] Removes the node at the cursor from its information set,
creating a new information set with just that node in it.
\item[Split:] Splits the information set with all of the nodes above the
cursor node remaining in the same infoset, while all of the nodes
below the cursor node are moved to a newly created infoset.

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} The split operation can be
achieved by moving the mouse cursor on top of the line connecting the
nodes in the infoset while holding down the {\tt Shift} key.  When the
mouse cursor is on top of the infoset line, it will change to
'scissors.'  Pressing the mouse button while the cursor is 'scissors'
will split the infoset.
\item[Join:] Removes the node at the cursor from its information set,
and puts it into the information set at the mark.
\item[Label:] Assigns a textual name to the information set.  These
names can be displayed on the extensive form display by appropriate
selection in the \helpref{}{} section. 
\item[Player:] This allows changing the player that has the choice at
this node.  You can choose any player except the one that is currently
selected.  If player names are being displayed on the tree, double
clicking on the name will also activate this operation.
\item[Reveal:] Reveals the information set to selected players.  This
will result in refining the information partitions of players to which
the information set is revealed in such a way that they observe all
actions at the information set.
\end{description}

\item[Outcomes:] Create, edit and delete outcomes
\begin{description}
\item[New:] Creates a new outcome for the game, and brings up the 
\helpref{Change Payoff}{ChangePayoff} dialog to edit the payoffs for
the outcome.  Note that outcomes need not be attached to any node.
Use the {\bf attach} item in this sub menu to attach the outcome to a
cell in the game. 
\item[Delete:] Deletes the selected outcome.  The outcome will be also
detached from any nodes in the extensive form game to which it was
attached. The \helpref{Select Outcome}{SelectOutcome} dialog is used
to select the outcome to delete.
\item[Attach:] Brings up the \helpref{Select Outcome}{SelectOutcome} 
dialog to select an outcome to attach to the selected node of the
extensive form.
\item[Detach:] Detaches the outcome from the selected node, resulting
in no outcome attached to the node.
\item[Label:] Assign a label or name to the outcome attached to
selected node.
\item[Payoffs:] Edit the payoffs of the outcome attached to the
selected node of the extensive form. The \helpref{Change 
Payoff}{ChangePayoff} dialog is used to edit the payoffs. If there is
no outcome attached, then a new outcome is created and attached to the
node.
\end{description}

\item[Tree:]
\begin{description}
\item[Copy] Copies the part of the tree following the mark to the
position of the cursor.  Note that the cursor must be at a terminal
node.  No new information sets are created by this operation.  Thus,
you may have to edit the information sets after this operation to
achieve the desired change.

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} The copy function can be
achieved by clicking on and dragging the source node to the target
node while holding down the {\bf Control} key.  The cursor will change
to a small 'tree' icon with the word 'copy' to indicate that a copy
operation is in progress.  Releasing the mouse while the cursor is not
on any terminal node will cancel the operation.
\item[Move] Moves the part of the game tree following the mark to the
position of the cursor.

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} The move function can be
achieved by clicking on and dragging the source node to the target
node. The cursor will change to a small 'tree' icon with the word
'move' to indicate that a move operation is in progress.  Releasing
the mouse while the cursor is not on any terminal node will cancel the
operation.
\item[Delete] The node at the cursor and all its descendants will be
deleted.

\helpref{Drag-And-Drop:}{DragAndDrop} The Delete Tree function can be
achieved by placing the cursor on the node line for the sub tree that
you want to delete, while pressing the shift key.  The cursor will
change to a scissors token.  Pressing the mouse button while the
scissors are displayed will delete the node and all its descendants
from the tree.
\item[Label] The label pertains to the game as a whole and will be
displayed on the titlebar of the window.
\item[Players] Each player must have a name.  Although not required,
it is highly recommended that these names be unique.  When a player is
first created, it is given a default name "Player \#."  This dialog
allows you to change these default names to something appropriate to
the game.
\item[Infoset] This dialog allows you to change the names of
information sets, remove empty information sets, and create new
information sets.
\end{description}
\end{description}

\subsection{Subgames Menu (efg)}\label{SubgamesMenu}

The following list describes the commands for working with subgames. 

\begin{description}
\item[Mark All:] Marks all subgames.  Note that the subgame roots now
become marked by small rectangles.
\item[Mark:] Check whether the selected node is a subgame root, and mark
it if it is.  If the selected node is not a root of a valid subgame, a
warning is issued.
\item[UnMark All:] Unmarks all subgames, consequently expanding all
subgames.
\item[UnMark:] If the cursor node is a marked subgame, that subgame is
removed from the list of subgames and is no longer considered either
for display or solution purposes.  If the cursor node is not a subgame
root, a warning is issued.
\item[Collapse Level:] If the cursor node is a subgame root, that
subgame is collapsed and all of the nodes contained in it are replaced
with a subgame icon.  The cursor changes shape to reflect this change.
\item[Collapse All:] Applies {\em Collapse} to every node that is
marked as a subgame root, including the ROOT node.
\item[Expand Level:] If the cursor node is a subgame root, that
subgame is expanded and all of the nodes, up to the first descendant
collapsed subgame, are displayed.
\item[Expand Branch:] If the cursor node is a subgame root, all of the
descendant subgames are expanded.
\item[Expand All:] Applies {\em Expand} to every node that is marked
as a subgame root.
\end{description}

\subsection{Supports Menu (efg)}\label{efsupport}

Several menu items are available for manipulating Normal form supports.  

\begin{description}
\item[Undominated:] Create new supports via elimination of dominated
strategies.  This brings up the \helpref{dominance
elimination}{UnDominated} dialog for selection of the type of
dominance elimination to use.
\item[New:] Used to create a new support for the extensive form game.
This brings up the \helpref{Edit Support}{EditSupport} dialog to select
the strategies for each player.  For a detailed explanation of a {\em
Support} see the section on \helpref{supports}{supportsec} in the
theory section.
\item[Edit:] Edit the current support to add or remove strategies from
it. The \helpref{Edit Support}{EditSupport} dialog is used.  
\item[Delete:] Delete a support from the list of supports.   
\item[Select:] Select a support from the list as the current support.  
\item[Root Reachable:] A toggle which determines how to draw an
extensive form without full support. If selected, only the nodes that
are reachable from the root node are drawn.  If not selected, then all
nodes are drawn, but only the branches corresponding to actions in the
support are drawn.
\end{description}

\subsection{Solve Menu (efg)}\label{efsolve}

\begin{description}
\item[Standard:] Uses standard settings to compute various types of
equilibria on the game.  The \helpref{Standard
Solution}{StandardSolution} dialog is used to select the type of
equilibrium to compute.
\item[Custom:] Allows the user to select a particular algorithm and
customize the settings for that algorithm.  Only a user familiar with
the algorithms used by Gambit should use the custom settings, since
the program makes no attempt to check for the validity of some of the
parameters.  For a detailed discussion of the 
\helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} see the appropriate sections.

Not all algorithms are applicable to all games.  If an algorithm is
not available for the currently loaded normal form, it will be grayed
out in the menu.  When a custom algorithm is selected, a customised
\helpref{Algorithm Parameters}{EFGCustomSolutions} diaolg will be
displayed to allow for select parameters for the algorithm.  

\begin{description}
\item[Extensive Form:] Algorithms that do computations directly on the extensive form of the game.  
\begin{description}
\item[EnumPure:] Finds all pure strategy equilibria of the game via

\end{description}

\subsection{Inspect Menu (efg)}\label{efinspect}

This menu item allows the selection of information to display:

\begin{description}
\item[Solutions:] Displays the extensive form \helpref{Solutions
Inspect}{ExtensiveSolutionInspect} dialog if there are any solutions in
the curent solution list.
\item[Cursor:] Displays the \helpref{Inspect Node}{InspectNode} dialog
which shows information about solution values for the selected
node. The displayed information continually updates as the extensive
form is navigated.
\item[Infosets:] When enabled, double clicking on an infoset in the EF
window will hilight the corresponding infoset in the Solution inspect
window.  Double clicking on an infoset (Iset column) in the Solution
inspection window will hilight the corresponding infoset in the EF

\item[Zoom Window:] Brings up the \helpref{Zoom Window}{ZoomWindow},
which provides a window into the game, centered around the selected
node.
\item[Game Info:] Displays selected information about the game, such
as the number of players, whether the game is Perfect Recall and
whether it is Constant Sum,
\end{description}

\subsection{Prefs Menu (efg)}\label{displaymenu}

The {\bf prefs} menu allows you to load, set and save various
parameters which affect the extensive form display.

\begin{description}
\item[Display:] This menu you to change parameters affecting the way

\item[Accels:] You can define and save accelerator keys for use in the
extensive form. A more complete discussion of this topic is given in
the section on \helpref{Accelerator Keys}{AcceleratorSec}
\item[Save:] Saves the current settings of the parameters in this menu.  These settings will become the default values.
\item[Load:] Loads the default settings of the parameters for this
menu.
\end{description}

\section{Extensive Form Solutions}\label{ExtensiveFormSolutions}

A large number of different \helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} 
are available for solving extensive form games.  In order to cater to
experienced users familiar with the properties of individual
algorithms, many parameters can be edited through a variety of
solution related dialog boxes.  To allow simpler access to the basic
features provided by the algorithms, a set of commonly used {\em
standard} solution types has been included with Gambit.  The user need
only determine the general features of the desired equilibria and
Gambit will take care of all the details.

All of the settings are saved to a defaults file every time they are
changed. There is no need to enter the custom parameters before each
recalculation, even through multiple sessions, unless a change is
required.  After selecting the solution type/parameters, the algorithm
must be started by selecting the Solve->Solve menu or pressing the
button on the toolbar.

\subsection{Subgames}\label{Subgames}
Gambit implements and supports the concept of a game theoretical
subgame. For the conditions necessary for a subtree to be qualified as
a subgame, see \cite{Selten:1975}.  Gambit can be made to selectively
recognize some, none, or all of the legal subgames in its solution
algorithms through the technique of marking subgames.

When an extensive form is first created or read in from a file, no
subgames (except for the default ROOT subgame) are marked.  If a node
is the root of a marked subgame, a small triangle is drawn at its
base.  Subgames can be collapsed for the purpose of better vieing a
large tree.  If a subgame is collapsed, all of the nodes it contains
are not displayed but replaced by a subgame icon.  Shift-clicking
(holding down the {\em SHIFT} key while clicking the left mouse
button) on a subgame root node will toggle the state of that subgame
(expanded vs. collapsed).  Refer to the following picture for an
example of subgame structures.


\begin{figure}
%$$\image{0cm;0cm}{subgame}$$
\caption{Simple efg with nontrivial subgames}\label{fig_subgames}
\end{figure}

All of the solution algorithms (with the current exception of the 
QRE algorithms) make use of the marked subgames.  When non-trivial 
subgames are defined, then the solution algorithms will solve the 
extensive form game by recursion through the marked subgames.  Thus, a 
subgame is solved only when all subgames following it have been 
solved.  

If all subgames are marked, then any Nash equilibrium found will be a
subgame perfect Nash equilibrium.  Note that the solution algorithms
only respect marked subgames, and hence if you want the solution
algorithms to make use of subgames, you must mark the subgames.  When
an algorithm encounters a subgame, the subgame is solved by itself and
the rest of the tree is resolved for each of the subgame solutions.
Clearly, the total number of solutions grows exponentially with the
number of subgames.  For advanced users, the {\bf 
Solve->Custom->Extensive->Algorithm} dialog provides the option to
interactively select which solutions are used for each subgame.  This
feature lets the advanced user concentrate on solutions of interest
while keeping the total number of solutions small.

\subsection{Extensive form Supports}
The concept of an extensive form support is very similar to that of a
normal form support.  Instead of considering the entire game tree, a
subset of all the player actions is considered.  That is, at each
decision node the player may have a reduced number of choices from
that of the original tree (full support).  However, at least one
action must exist at each node.  Most of the extensive form solution
algorithms support, the notion of extensive form supports.

An extensive form support can be generated in one of two ways--either by 
dominated strategy elimination or by explicit creation of a new support.  
To eliminate dominated strategies in an extensive form game, you use the 
\helpref{Support->UnDominated}{UnDominated} menu item.  

To create a support, use the \helpref{Edit Support}{EditSupport} 
dialog, which is accessible via the {\bf Supports->New} menu item.


\subsection{EFG Standard Solutions}\label{EFGStandardSolutions}
The standard solutions are selected by the {\bf Solve->Standard} menu.
The particular settings are then picked in the dialog box.  You can
select a refinement of Nash equilibrium to compute (Nash, Subgame
perfect, and Sequential), and a maximum number of solutions to
compute.  When you select a standard solution setting, it
automatically sets various parameters that control the solution
computation.  These factors include whether to mark subgames before
solving, whether and how to iteratively eliminate dominated
strategies, which algorithm to use for the computation, and the
maximum number of solutions to search for before finishing the
computation.  The settings for each of the standard solutions are
given in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|l|}
\ruledrow{Type & Number & Game Type & Subgames & UnDominated & Algorithm & Notes} 
\hline
\row{Nash & One &  2-person constant sum&  Mark & Weak & EF/LP-1 &}
\row{     &     &  2-person general sum &  Mark & Weak & EF/LCP-1 &}
\row{     &     &  n-person             &  Mark & Weak & NF/SimpDiv-1 &}
\hline
\row{Nash & Two &  2-person             &  Unmark & Strong & NF/EnumMixed-2 &}
\row{     &     &  n-person             &  Unmark & Strong & EF/Liap-2 &Not guaranteed}
\hline
\row{Nash & All &  2-person             &  Unmark & Strong & NF/EnumMixed-0 &}
\row{     &     &  n-person             &  Unmark & Strong & EF/PolEnum &}

\row{Subgame Perfect & One &  2-person constant sum&  Mark & Weak & EF/LP-1 &}
\row{                &     &  2-person general sum &  Mark & Weak & EF/LCP-1 &}
\row{                &     &  n-person             &  Mark & Weak & NF/SimpDiv-1 &}
\hline

\hline
\row{Subgame Perfect & All &  2-person             &  Mark & Strong & NF/EnumMixed-0 &}

\row{Sequential & One &  2 or n-person          &  Unmark & None & EF/QRE-1 &}
\hline
\row{Sequential & Two &  2 or n-person          &  Unmark & None & EF/Liap-2 &Not guaranteed}
\hline
\row{Sequential & All &  2 or n-person          &  Unmark & None & EF/Liap-0 &Not guaranteed}
\hline
\end{tabular}

In the entry for the algorithm for the above table, first is indicated
whether the algorithm is applied to the extensive (EF) or normal (NF)
form. Then the name of the algorithm is given.  Finally, the number
after the algorithm indicates the maximum number of solutions to be
found.  If this number is 0, the algorithm will only terminate when it
has found all solutions.  For algorithms which are not guaranteed to
find all solutions (such as Liap), the algorithm will enter an
infinite loop, and continue to search until the computation is aborted
by the user.

\subsection{EFG Custom Solutions}\label{EFGCustomSolutions}
Only a user familiar with the algorithms should use the custom
settings since the program makes no attempt to check for the validity
of some of the parameters.  For a detailed discussion of the 
\helpref{algorithms}{SolutionAlgorithms} see the appropriate sections.

A custom algorithm is selected in the {\bf Solve->Custom} submenu.
The game can be solved either by algorithms that work directly on the
extensive form, or by conversion to the normal form, and solving with
algorithms on the normal form.  In the later case, a normal form
representation will be automatically created, the algorithm run and
the solutions converted back to behavioral strategy profiles.

The sub menus {\bf Solve->Custom->Extensive} and {\bf 
Solve->Custom->Normal} are used to access algorithms which work on the
extensive and normal forms respectively.  Not all algorithms are
applicable to all games (for example, Linear Programming and Linear
Complementarity algorithms can only be applied to two person games.)
Algorithms that are not applicable to the current game will be greyed
out in the menu.

After selecting an algorithm, the Algorithm parameter dialog will
appear. Each solution is controlled by three groups of settings, which
appear on the dialog box for the algorithm in the following order:

\begin{description}
\item[Dominance elimination:] Prior to running the algorithm, dominated
strategies may be eliminated, thus speeding up the consequent
calculations.  For normal form algorithms, the domination is done on
the reduced normal form after converting the game to normal form.  For
extensive form algorithms, dominance elimination is done directly on
the extensive form (Note: dominance elimination on the extensive form
can be slower than on the reduced normal form since it grows in
complexity with the size of the agent normal form of the game.)

The type of dominance elimination is controlled by radioboxes at the
top of the dialog box for the algorithm.  In the case of algorithms
that work on the normal form, the same options are available as is
described in the normal form algorithm section:
\begin{description}
\item[Depth:] Determines whether and how much dominance elimination is
to be done.  {\bf None} indicates no dominance elimination is to be
done, {\bf Once} selects a single step of elimination, and {\bf 
Iterative} selects iterative elimination of dominated strategies.
\item[Type:] Determines whether to use weak or strong domination.
\item[Method:] Determines whether to eliminate strategies that are
dominated only by pure strategies or whether to also eliminate
strategies dominated by mixed strategies.  Elimination by pure
strategies is faster, but may not find all dominated strategies, as it
is possible that strategies that are not dominated by any pure
strategy may be dominated by a mixed strategy.  For algorithms that
work directly on the extensive form, the {\bf Pure/Mixed} selection is
not available.

\end{description}

\item[Subgames:] \helpref{Subgames}{SubgamesMenu} may be marked prior
to running any algorithm.  If subgames are marked, Gambit will apply
the selected algorithm to each subgame in reverse tree traversal
order.  All solutions at each subgame are used to generate
continuation values for the higher level subgames.  Marking subgames
before running an algorithm that computes Nash equilibria will insure
that all equilibria computed are subgame perfect Nash equilibria.

If there are a lot of subgames, and each subgame produces multiple 
solutions, the total number of solutions can grow exponentially.  
To interactively select which solutions to the subgames to keep, toggle 
the {\bf interactively select subgames} checkbox.  

\item[Algorithm parameters] The remainder of the dialog box is devoted
to parameters specific to the algorithm. Refer to the algorithm
section for these parameters.

\end{description}

Note that some algorithms require a starting point.  Depending on the
options selected in the custom parameters dialog for these algorithms,
a starting point dialog may pop up before the algorithm is run.  The
default (centroid) is usually a good place to start.  Double clicking
on the first profile in the window and pressing {\bf OK} will select
the default and allow the algorithm to continue.  Advanced users may
choose to use values obtained by solving the game using a different
algorithm as a starting point.

\subsection{EFG Solutions and Subgames}\label{EFGSolnSubg}
If the extensive form contains more than one subgame, and if the
subgames are either marked explicitly or implicitly by selecting the 
{\bf Mark Subgames}, Gambit will apply the selected algorithm to each
subgame in reverse tree traversal order.  For each solution obtained
at a subgame node, a full solution will exist.  If there are a lot of
subgames, and each subgame produces multiple solutions, the total
number of solutions grows exponentially.

To provide the user with interactive control over which subgame
solutions will be used to compute the full solutions, the subgame
solution picking dialog can be used.  This option is enabled from the
main Custom solutions dialog by checking the {\bf intractively select
subgame solutions} checkbox.  When enabled, for each subgame solved by
Gambit, a solution display window will be created and the user must
select the subgame solutions to be used for further calculations.
Solutions are selected/deselected by {\bf double-clicking} or {\bf 
Ctrl-clicking} on the corresponding solution number.  At least one
solution must be selected for each subgame.

\begin{figure}
%$$\image{0cm;0cm}{efgpick}$$
\caption{Subgame solution picking dialog w/ all solns selected}\label{fig_efgpick}
\end{figure}

To speed up solution selection two shortcuts exist:

\begin{description}
\item[Select/unselect all of the solutions at once.]  The dialog
starts up with all of the solutions in the same state (selected or
unselected) depending on the current default (see next item).  If all
of the solutions are selected, a {\bf None} button will exist.
Pressing the button will unselect all of the solutions.  The button
will then change to {\bf All}.  Pressing the {\bf All} button will
select all of the solutions.
\item[Default selection parameter.]  The startup state of the solution
picking dialog can be controlled through the {\bf Opt} button.  The
{\bf Pick All Solutions} item is saved to a defaults file and is used
for all future dialogs.
\end{description}

\subsection{Default Accelerator Keys}\label{ExtFormDefAccl}
To speed up some of the more commonly used commands in the GUI, a set of
{\em accelerator keys} may be defined.  Once defined, a combination of keys
can be used to activate most of the menus and buttons.  Accelerator key
definitions are accessed through the Prefs->Accels menu.  Accelerator key
definitions are saved in the main Gambit defaults file (gambit.ini).  Gambit
is distributed with the following keys defined.
\begin{description}
\item[ENTER:] Marks the node (Edit->Node->Mark)
\item[SPACE:] Redraws the screen.  
\end{description}

\chapter{Solutions of Games}

\section{\index{Supports}{Supports}}\label{supportsec}

A support is a subset of the strategies or actions of a game which is
of interest for some reason.  Usually the reason for looking at a
support that is less than the full support is to eliminate dominated
strategies.  All of the solution algorithms in Gambit take the current
support as an argument.  When starting analysis of any game, the
current support is the full support of the game.  New supports are
created either through elimination of dominated strategies or explicit
creation of a support.  This functionality is accessed via the {\bf
Support} menu item in either the \helpref{Normal Form}{nfsupports} or
\helpref{Extensive Form}{efsupport} GUI.

\section{Equilibria}

\subsection{\index{Nash equilibrium}{Nash Equilibrium}}\label{nashsec}
Every finite game has at least one \popref{Nash 
equilibrium}{nashequigloss} in either pure or mixed strategies
(\cite{Nash:1950}).

Gambit has a number of algorithms to find Nash equilibria.  The
appropriate algorithm to use depends on a number of factors, most
importantly, the number of players in the game, and the number of
equilibria you want to find.  For a detailed discussion of these
issues, see \cite{McKMcL:1996}.

Before computing equilibria, you may wish to \helpref{eliminate
dominated strategies}{UnDominated} from the support.  The smaller the
support, the faster any algorithm will run.  However, dominance
elimination can itself be computationally intensive, especially if
mixed domination is used, or if dominance elimination is done on the
extensive form.

\begin{itemize}
\item 
If you want to find more than one, or all Nash equilibria of a game,
then you may first successively eliminate strongly dominated
strategies.  Any equilibrium of the original game will also be an
equilibrium of the reduced game.
\item 
If you just want to find {\em one} Nash equilibrium, you can first
successively eliminate {\em weakly} dominated strategies.  Elimination
of weakly dominated strategies may eliminate some Nash equilibria of
the original game (so it should not be used if you want to find
multiple Nash equilibria,) but any Nash equilibrium to the reduced
game will be an equilibrium to the original game, so it can be used if
you only want to find one equilibrium .
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Pure Equilibria}\label{purenashsec}
The \helpref{EnumPure}{EnumPure} algorithm can be used to enumerate
all of the pure strategy equilibria for both extensive and normal form
games.  select EnumPure, and check {\em Use NF}.  This will find all pure
strategy Nash equilibria of the associated reduced normal form of the
game, and convert them to behavior strategies.

\subsubsection{Two Person Constant Sum Games}\label{csumsec}
For two person constant sum normal form games, the minimax theorem
applies.  The set of Nash equilibria is a convex set, and the problem
of finding Nash equilibria can be formulated as a linear program.  The 
\helpref{Lp algorithm}{Lp} will solve a constant sum game using this
approach.

\subsubsection{Two Person Games}\label{twopersec}
For two person nonzero sum games, the problem of finding Nash
equilibria can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem, and
exact solutions can be found as long as computations are done in
rationals.  The \helpref{Lcp algorithm}{Lcp} solves a two person game
using this approach.  Note that the Lcp algorithm can also be used
directly on an extensive form game, where it implements the Koller,
Megiddo, von Stengel Sequence form \cite{KolMegSte:94}.  To find {\em 
one} Nash equilibrium use Lcp with nEquilib set to 1.

For a two person game the \helpref{EnumMixed algorithm}{EnumMixed} 
will enumerate all of the extreme points of the components of the set
of Nash equilibria, and hence can be used to find {\em all} Nash
equilibria.  Using EnumMixed with nEquilib set to 0 will find all Nash
equilibria.  To find if there is more than one Nash equilibrium use
EnumMixed with nEquilib set to 2.

\subsubsection{N Person Games}\label{npernashsec}
For n-person normal form games, with n greater than two, the
\helpref{PolEnum}{PolEnum} algorithm will find all Nash
equilibria. The PolEnum algorithm may be computationally infeasible on
large games.  Thus other algorithms are also available for finding one
or a sample of Nash equilibria.  Since Nash equilibria can be
irrational, the algorithms to locate one equilibrium will only find
approximations (to machine accuracy) of Nash equilibria.

The \helpref{SimpDiv algorithm}{SimpDiv} is guaranteed to locate one
equilibrium for an n-person normal form game.  This algorithm can be
very slow on some games.  Hence two other algorithms are also
supported, \helpref{QRE}{QRE} and \helpref{Liap}{Liap}.  These
algorithms can also be used to search for multiple equilibria (with no
guarantee that all have been found,) and to search for equilibria
close to a given starting point.

\subsection{\index{Sequential Equilibrium}{sequential equilibrium}}\label{seqnashsec}
Sequential equilibria are equilibria that prescribe optimal behavior
at any information set of the extensive form, given a consistent
assessment of beliefs.  See \cite{KrepsWilson:1982}.  To compute an
approximation to a sequential equilibrium you can select QRESolve in
the Extensive form Solve menu.

\section{Solution Algorithms}\label{SolutionAlgorithms}

\subsection{EnumMixed}\label{EnumMixed}
Finds all Nash equilibria for a two person game.  More precisely, it
finds the set of extreme points of the components of the set of Nash
equilibria.  The procedure is to enumerate the set of complementary
basic feasible solutions (see eg. /cite{Man:64}.)

{\em Limitations:} Only works for two-person normal form games.

The following parameters can be set:

\begin{description}
\item[Stop After:] Specifies the maximum number of equilibria to find.  The
default is zero, which means that all equilibria are found.  To check if
there is a unique Nash equilibrium, one could set this parameter to 2.
\item[precision:] Select {\bf Rational} for exact computations, {\bf 
Float} for speed. See the section on \helpref{Data Types}{DataTypes}
for more information.
\end{description}

\subsection{EnumPure}\label{EnumPure}
Computation of pure strategy Nash equilibria is done by simple enumeration.
All pure strategies are checked to see if they are Nash equilibria.  

The following parameters can be set. 

\begin{description}
\item[Stop After:] Allows the user to set the maximum number of Nash
equilibria to find. 
\end{description}


\subsection{QRE}\label{QRE}
Computes a branch of the logistic {\em quantal response equilibrium} 
correspondence for n-person normal form games (as described 
in \cite{McKPal:95a}  and n-person extensive form games (as described 
in \cite{McKPal:95b}.) The branch is computed 
for values of $\lambda$ between $minLam$ and $maxLam$.  The algorithm 
starts at $\lambda(0) = minLam$ if $delLam > 0$, or 
$\lambda(0) = maxLam$ if 
$delLam < 0$. It then increments according to the formula 
$$
\lambda(t+1) = \lambda(t) +delLam \lambda(t)^a.
$$
where $minLam$, $maxLam$, $delLam$, and $a$ are
parameters described below. In the computation for the first value of
$\lambda(0)$, the algorithm begins its search for a solution at the
starting point determined by the parameter \verb+start+.  At each
successive value of $\lambda(t)$, the algorithm begins it's search at
the point found in step \verb+t - 1+.  

This algorithm returns the last point computed.  If the starting point
is set to the centroid of the game (this is the default), and $delLam 
> 0$, then this algorithm computes the {\em principal branch} of the
logistic Quantal response equilibrium.  In this case taking the limit,
as $\lambda$ goes to 0, the quantal response equilibrium defines a
unique selection from the set of Nash equilibrium for generic normal
form games.  Similarly, for extensive form games, it defines a
selection from the set of sequential equilibria.  Therefore, in
extensive form games, this algorithm can be used to compute
approximations to a sequential equilibrium.

{\bf Limitations:} This algorithm currently can become numerically
unstable on some problems for high values of $\lambda$, and may
generate singularity errors.  Hence on some problems it may not be
possible with the current implementation to obtain a sufficiently
close approximation to an equilibrium.

The following parameters can be set:

\begin{description}
\item[minLam:] Sets the minimum value of $\lambda.$ 
Default is $\lambda = 0.01$.
\item[maxLam:] Sets the maximum value of $\lambda.$  Default is 
$\lambda = 30.0.$
\item[delLam:]  The constant, $\delta,$ used in incrementing.   Default is 
$\delta = .01.$
\item[Plot type:] Determines the exponent, $a,$ used in incrementing 
$\lambda.$  {\em Linear} corresponds to setting $a = 0,$ and {\em 
logarithmic} corresponds to setting $a = 1.$ Default is logarithmic.
\item[Starting Point:] Selects the rule for choosing the starting
point of the search for the initial value of $\lambda.$ {\bf Default} 
is the centroid, where all strategies are chosen with equal
probability (not implemented yet.)
\item[Accuracy:] Sets the accuracy desired in the computation.
Default is $1.0e-8.$ 
\item[Run PXI:] A checkbox to determine whether to launch the external
PXI program to plot the QRE correspondence.  If this is checked, both
of the following fields must also be specified.
\item[PXI File:] Specifies a pathname to store the QRE correspondence
in a format compatible for input to PXI, a program for graphical
viewing and display of the output.
\item[PXI command:] Specifies the location of the pxi program.  A full
pathname should be specified.
\end{description}

\subsection{QRE Grid}\label{QREAll}
Performs a grid search to compute the complete logistic
quantal response correspondence (as described in \cite{McKPal:95a}
for a {\em small} two-person normal form game.

The algorithm computes approximate fixed points of the correspondence
for the correspondence for values of $\lambda$ between \verb+minLam+
and \verb+maxLam+.  Starting at $\lambda = minLam$, $\lambda$ is
incremented according to the formula $$ \lambda(t+1) = \lambda(t)
+delLam \lambda(t)^a.$$ where $minLam$, $maxLam$, $delLam$, and $a$
are parameters described below. For each value of $\lambda$, a grid
search is done over all values of the probabilities for player $1$,
evaluated on a grid of mesh 'del p.'  Points are evaluated in terms of
the value of an objective function that measures the distance between
the original point, and the best response to the best response (under
the logistic best response function.)  Points with a value of the
objective function less than \verb+Tolerance+ are approximate fixed
points, and are kept, others are discarded.  A two stage procedure is
used, in which the entire space is searched on a course grid of mesh
'delp1'.  Any points on the course grid for which the value of the
objective function is less than 'tol1' are then searched on a finer
grid of mesh 'delp2' around that point.  Points on the finer grid for
which the value of the objective function is below 'tol2' = 'tol' are
kept.

{\bf Limitations:} This algorithm is {\bf very} computationally
intensive, and should only be attampted on small games.

The following parameters can be set for {\bf QRE Grid}.

\begin{description}
\item[minLam:] Sets the minimum value of $\lambda.$
Default is $\lambda = .01.$
\item[maxLam:]  Sets the maximum value of $\lambda.$
Default is $\lambda = 3.$ 
\item[delLam:] Specifies the rate at which the value of Lambda changes.
Has a default value of .1.
\item[Plot Type:] Specifies whether to have geometric or linear incrementing.
Default is 0, resulting in $a = 1,$ or !geometric incrementing.
\item[Grid 1 Del:] Grid size for search over course grid of probability space.
\item[Grid 1 Tol:] Maximum value of objective function for which to accept
solution on course grid.
\item[Use MultiGrid:] Checking this box causes the two stage procedure
to be used, in which case the next two parameters neet to also be
specified.
\item[Grid 2 Del:] Grid size for search over fine grid of probability space.  
\item[Grid 2 Tol:] Maximum value of objective function for which to
accept solution on fine grid.
\item[Run PXI:] A checkbox to determine whether to launch the external
PXI program to plot the QRE correspondence.  If this is checked, both
of the following fields must also be specified.
\item[PXI File:] Specifies a pathname to store the QRE correspondence
in a format compatible for input to PXI, a program for graphical
viewing and display of the output.
\item[PXI command:] Specifies the location of the pxi program.  A full
pathname should be specified.
\end{description}

\subsection{Lcp}\label{Lcp}
This algorithm formulates and solves the game as a linear
complementarity problem.  For a normal form game, this algorithm
searches for equilibria of the specified normal form game using the
Lemke-Howson algorithm, as described in \cite{LemHow:64}. Eaves
\cite{Eav:71} lexicographic rule for linear complementarity problems
is used to avoid cycling.

In the Lemke Howson algorithm equilibria are found by following paths
of ``almost'' equilibria, where one relaxes at most one constaint.
Equilibria are thus inter-connected by networks of paths that result
when different of the constraints are relaxed.  One can find the set
of ``accessible'' equilibria in such methods by starting at the
extraneous solution and then tracing out this entire network.  See,
e. g., Shapley, \cite{Sha:74}.  However, the set of accessible
equilibria is not necessarily all Nash equilibria.

For extensive form games, this algorithm implements Lemke's algorithm
on the ``sequence form'' of the game, as defined by Koller, Megiddo
and von Stengel, in \cite{KolMegSte:94}.

{\bf Limitations:} This algorithm is fast, but only works for two
person games.  \cite{Wilson:1971} and \cite{Rosenmuller:1971} have
suggested ways in which the Lemke-Howson Algorithm can be extended to
general $n$-player games, but these extensions require methods of
tracing the solution to a set of non linear simultaneous equations,
and have not been implemented in Gambit.  Also, on some problems with
data type of Double, the current implementation can exhibit numerical
instability which in extreme cases can even lead to incorrect
solutions.  Solving the same problem with Rationals will resolve any
such difficulties.  However, the algorithm is much slower when
operating on Rationals than on Doubles.

The following parameters can be specified:

\begin{description}
\item[Stop After:] Specifies the number of equilibria to find.  If not
specified, the default value is zero, which means that all equilibria
reachable by the algorithm (see above) are to be found.
\end{description}

\subsection{Liap}\label{Liap}
Finds Nash equilibria via the Lyapunov function method
described in \cite{McK:91}.  Works on either the extensive or normal
form.  This algorithm casts the problem as a function minimization
problem by use of a Lyapunov function for Nash equilibria.  This is a
continuously differentiable non negative function whose zeros coincide
with the set of Nash equilibria of the game.  A standard descent
algorithm is used to find a constrained local minimum of the function
from any given starting location.  Since a local minimum need not be a
global minimum (with value 0,) the algorithm is not guaranteed to find
a Nash equilibrium from any fixed starting point.  The algorithm thus
incorporates the capability of restarting.  The algorithm starts from
the initial starting point determined by the parameter 'start'.  If a
Nash equilibrium is not found, it will keep searching from new
randomly chosen starting points until a Nash equilibrium has been
found or the maximum number of tries (parameter 'ntries') is exceeded,
whichever comes first.  For an extensive form game, if the algorithm
converges, it converges to a sequential equilibrium (Andrew Solnick,
personal communication).

{\bf Limitations:} The disadvantages of this method are that it is
generally slower than any of the above methods, and also, there can be
local minima to the Liapunov function which are not zeros of the
function.  Thus the algorithm can potentially converge to a non Nash
point.  However, inspection of the objective function can determine if
this problem has occurred.  If the objective function is zero, a Nash
equilibrium has been found. If it is greater than zero, the point is
not Nash.  The algorithm will automatically check this.  If the
objective function is larger than the tolerance, then the point is
discarded.

The following parameters can be set;

\begin{description}
\item[Stop After:] Sets the number of equilibria to find.  Has a
default value of 1. Note that checking {\bf Find all} results
(intentionally) in an infinite loop that will continue until
terminated by the user.
\item[nTries:] Sets the maximum number of attempts at finding each
equilibrium. Note that a value of 0 means the algorithm will continue
forever, or until the algorithm is terminated by the user, whichever
comes first.
\item[Accuracy:] Sets the accuracy desired in the computation.
Default is $1.0e-8.$ 
\item[start:] Sets the starting profile for the descent algorithm.
{\bf Default} is the centroid.
\end{description}

\subsection{Lp}\label{Lp}
This algorithm formulates and solves the game as a linear program, and
finds the minimax solution of the game.  This algorithm only works for
two person, zero sum games.

This algorithm only finds one Nash equilibrium.  However, For a
constant sum game, any other equilibria will have the same value.
There are no algorithm specific parameters.

\subsection{PolEnum}\label{PolEnum}
Solves for all totally mixed Nash equilibrium of the game on a given
support. The algorithm iterates through all sub-supports of the
initial support to find the full support equilibria on each
sub-support.  Supports with singular solutions are skipped by the
algorithm when determined to have singular solutions.

On each sub-support, the algorithm starts with a cube containing the
space of possible solutions and proceeds recursively.  The recursion
step begins with a subcube.  The subcube is discarded if the cube is
irrelevant in the sense of lying outside the space of possible
solutions.  Otherwise a modified Newton's method is used to search for
a solution in the subcube.  In the event that such a solution is
found, Taylor's series information at the solution is used to inquire
whether the solution is necessarily the unique solution in the
subcube.  If Newton's method leaves the subcube before finding a
solution, Taylor's series information at the center is used to inquire
whether we can be sure that the subcube contains no solutions.  If
neither of these procedures resolves the issue, the subcube is
subdivided and this recursion is performed on each smaller subcube.
Supports with singular solutions 

The following optional parameters may be used to modify the behavior
of the algorithm:

\begin{description}
\item[Stop After:] By default, all equilibria are found.  This
parameter may be used to specify a maximum number of equilibria to be
found.
\item[Singular Supps:] Returns a list of the supports which have
singular solutions. {\bf Note:} This is currently not implemented in
the GUI, but is available in the GCL.
\item[recurse:] Determines whether to recurse to all sub supports.
Default is {\bf True}. 
\end{description}

\subsection{SimpDiv}\label{SimpDiv}
Computes a Nash equilibrium to a normal form game based on a
simplicial subdivision algorithm.  The algorithm implemented is that
of \cite{VTH:1987}.  The algorithm is a simplicial subdivision
algorithm which can start at any point in the simplex.  The algorithm
starts with a given grid size, follows a path of almost completely
labeled subsimplexes, and converges to a completely labeled
sub-simplex that approximates the solution.  Additional accuracy is
obtained by refining the grid size and restarting from the previously
found point.  The idea is that by restarting at a close approximation
to the solution, each successive increase in accuracy will yield a
short path, and hence be quick.

In its pure form, the algorithm is guaranteed to find at least one
mixed strategy equilibrium to any n-person game.  Experience shows
that the algorithm works well, and is acceptably fast for many
moderate size problems.  But in some examples it can be quite slow.
The reason for this is that sometimes after restarting with a refined
grid size, even though the starting point is a good approximation to
the solution, the algorithm will go to the boundary of the simplex
before converging back to a point that is close to the original
starting point.  When this occurs, each halving of the grid size will
take twice as long to converge as the previous grid size.  If a high
degree of accuracy is required, or if the normal form is large, this
can result in the algorithm taking a long time to converge.

In order to combat the above difficulty, a parameter 'leash' has been
added to the algorithm which places a limit on the distance which the
algorithm can wander from the restart point. (Setting this parameter
to 0 results in no limit, and gives the pure form of the algorithm.)
With this parameter set to a non trivial value, the algorithm is no
longer guaranteed to converge, and setting small values of the
parameter will sometimes yield lack of convergence.  However,
experience shows that values of the parameter on the order of 10
generally do not destroy convergence, and yield much faster
convergence.

Parameters:

\begin{description}
\item[Stop after:] Maximum number of equilibria to find. Default is 1.  
\item[n Restarts:] Number of restarts.  At each restart the mesh of the
triangulation is halved.  So this parameter determines the final mesh
by the formula ${1/2}^{ndivs}$.
\item[Leash:] Sets the leashlength. Default is 0, which results in no
constraint, or no leash.  
\end{description}

\chapter{External Programs}
One particularly useful feature of gambit is the ability to generate complete 
logistic quantal response correspondence for normal form games.  These
algorithms generate a very large amount of data that is not easily visualized.
To display this data we created a specialized data plotting program {\em PXI}.


\begin{figure}
%$$\image{3cm;3cm}{pxibig}$$
\caption{Sample PXI screenshot}\label{fig_pxibig}
\end{figure}

{\em PXI} was not funded from the same source as Gambit itself, but was 
developed largely independently by Eugene Grayver.  PXI is not limited to
plotting data generated by Gambit, but can be used to visualize a wide range
of econometric data.  It features four unique chart types, publication quality
graphics output, and an easy to use graphical interface.  PXI is available on
most platforms supported by Gambit.  We strongly recommend using PXI if
either \helpref{QRE}{QRE} or \helpref{QREAll}{QREAll} algorithms are used.

\normalboxd{ PXI is being released as {\em shareware} and its source code is available
upon request.

\gloss{Action}\label{actiongloss}
An action is a collection of branches, one at each node of a player's information 
set, which are indistinguishable to the player making a decision at that 
information set. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, each information set has two actions.  For the 
second player, at her information set, the two branches labeled MEET are one 
action, and the two branches labeled PASS are another action.
 
\gloss{Branch}\label{branchgloss}
A branch is the line connecting two nodes, one of which immediately 
follows the other.  Branches are numbered from 1 to k, where k is the 
number of branches at the node.  Branch 1 is the uppermost branch.  Branch 
2 is the second uppermost branch, etc. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, each decision node has two branches, but in
other extensive forms, the number of branches can be different.

\gloss{Contingency}\label{continggloss}
A contingency for player i is a profile of strategies adopted by the other
 n - 1 players.

\gloss{Decision Node}\label{decnodegloss}
A decision node is a node which has at least one node that follows it.  
Decision nodes represent points at which either a player or chance must 
make a decision.  The different choices are represented by branches.

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, there are a total of five decision nodes (including the chance node). 
 The number of the player who makes a choice at a node appears underneath the
node as the first number after the parenthesis.  On the graphics screen,
decision nodes are color coded, with each player represented by a
different color.

\gloss{Domination}\label{dominationgloss}
A strategy s for player i 
{\em weakly dominates} strategy t if, in every contingency, s 
is at least as good as t, and there is some contingency in which it is 
better.  The strategy s {\em strongly dominates} t if it is 
strictly better than t for player i in every contingency.  

In the poker example of \helpref{Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}}{normformsec}, 
for player 1, strategy \verb+21+ is weakly dominated by strategy \verb+12+, 
and strongly dominated by \verb+11+. 

\gloss{GUI}\label{guigloss}
This Program -- the Gambit Graphics User Interface.

\gloss{GCL}\label{gclgloss}
The Gambit Command Language -- a programming language for manipulation and
solution of extensive and normal form games.  This language is designed
for repetitive and computer intensive operations on games.  

\gloss{Indexed Traversal Order}\label{indextravgloss}
This is the ordering imposed on the nodes of a game tree by a lexicographic 
ordering of the nodes when each node is identified by the sequence of branch 
numbers necessary to reach it.  

\gloss{Information Set}\label{infosetgloss}
An information set is a collection of nodes which are all controlled by
the same player, but which are indistinguishable 
for the player who is making the decision.  Since any two nodes 
in the same information set are indistinguishable, they must have exactly 
the same number of immediately following nodes. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, player 1 has two information
sets, labeled (1, 1) and (1, 2), and player 2 has one, labeled (2, 1).
Player 2 has only one information set because Player 2 does not know whether
 Player 1 drew a red card or a black card from the deck.  So 2's decision 
cannot be contingent on that information.

\gloss{Nash Equilibrium}\label{nashequigloss}
A Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile having the property that no player 
can strictly benefit from unilaterally changing its strategy, while all 
other players stay fixed.  

\gloss{Node}\label{nodegloss}
A node is either decision node or a terminal node.  In the graphics 
display, a node is any location to which you can navigate the graphics 
cursor. In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, there are a total of eleven nodes -- namely 
five decision nodes (including the chance node), and six terminal nodes.  

\gloss{Outcome}\label{outcomegloss}
Outcomes are payoff vectors that associate with each player a payoff.  
Outcomes can be attached to any node, terminal or non terminal, in the 
extensive form of the game.  When play passes or terminates at a node 
with an outcome attached to it, each player accumulates the payoff which 
is associated to that player by the outcome at that node. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, there is an outcome attached to each of the
terminal nodes.  They are indicated by the pair of numbers at each
terminal node.  The first number represents the payoff to player 1 and the
second the payoff to player 2.

\gloss{Poker Description}\label{pokergloss}
\begin{verbatim} 
Each player ante's $1.00 into the pot before starting
Player 1 (RED) draws a card from a deck. Player 1 observes the card, 2 (BLUE) does not. 
Player 1 then decides whether to FOLD or RAISE. 
  If player 1 chooses FOLD, then 
     Player 1 wins the pot if the card is RED (a net gain of $1.00 to RED).
     Player 2 wins the pot if the card is BLACK (a net loss of $1.00 to RED).
  If player 1 chooses RAISE, then player 1 throws a dollar in the pot, and player 2 moves
    If player 2 chooses PASS, then player 1 wins the pot (a net gain of $2.00to RED)
    If player 2 chooses MEET, player 2 throws a dollar in the pot, and 1 must show the card: 
      If the card is RED Player 1 wins the pot (a net gain of $2.00 to RED).
      If the card is BLACK Player 2 wins the pot (a net loss of $2.00 to RED)
\end{verbatim}

\gloss{PureStrategies}\label{purestratgloss} 
A pure strategy for player i is a plan of action for that player for the 
entire game.  Thus, it is a specification of what branch to select at each 
of the player's information sets.  If player i's j th information set has 
k(j) branches.  Then the total number of pure strategies for player i is 
k(1) x k(2) x . . . x k(J).

\gloss{Realization Probability}\label{realprobgloss}
With each strategy profile, there is associated, to each node in the 
extensive form, a realization probability.  This is the probability of
 reaching that node under the given strategy profile.  This probability is 
computed by finding the path from the root node to the given node, and then 
computing the product of the probabilities of selecting each branch along 
the path.  

Note that all nodes, not just terminal nodes have realization probabilities
 attached to them.  The realization probability of the decision node at RED 
RAISE is 0.5.  The realization probability of the Root node is always 1.

\gloss{Reduced Normal Form}\label{rednormgloss}
The reduced normal form is the game that results when all strategies that 
are identical (result in  the same payoffs for all contingencies of the 
other players are represented by a single strategy.  

In many extensive form games, there are cases in which a choice adopted by 
a player early in the play precludes that player from ever reaching other 
of its information sets.  In this situation, the decisions that the player 
makes at the unreached information sets can not possibly affect the  payoff
 to that player(or to any other player).  Two strategies for a given player
 that differ only in what branch is selected at an unreachable'  information
 set will generate rows (or columns, as the case may be) in the normal form 
that are identical.  The reduced normal form eliminates such duplicated 
strategies, representing each duplicated strategy by its wildcard notation.  

\gloss{Root Node}\label{rootnodegloss}
The root node of a tree is the node with no parent. In the GAMBIT graphics
representation, the Root node is always the node that is furthest to the
left.  It can be reached by successively pressing {\bf $\leftarrow$}. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, the Root node is the unlabeled node, furthest to 
the left.

\gloss{Strategy Profile}\label{stratprofgloss}
A strategy profile is an n-tuple of strategies, one for each player. The 
total number of strategy profiles is equal to the product of the number of 
strategies for each player. 
 
In the game of  Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, the total number of strategy profiles
 is 8. 

\gloss{Subgame}\label{subgamegloss}
A subgame is a subtree with the property that for every information 
set containing members in the subtree, all members of the information 
set are elements of the subtree.  In other words, every information set 
is either contained in or has empty intersection with the subtree. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, there are no proper subtrees of the extensive
form, because every subtree except that starting at the Root node breaks
up Player 2's information set.

\gloss{Subtree}\label{subtreegloss}
A subtree is a decision node together with the collection of nodes that
follow it in the tree.  Note that any subtree itself has a tree structure.

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, each decision node defines a subtree consisting of itself
and its followers.   

\gloss{Terminal Node}\label{termnodegloss}
A terminal node is a node which has no other node following it.  Terminal 
nodes represent points at which the extensive form game ends, and typically 
have outcomes attached to them. 

In Figure~\ref{fig_samp1}, there are six terminal nodes, each followed by
a pair of numbers representing the payoffs to each player when that
terminal node is reached.

\gloss{Topological Tree}\label{toptreegloss}
A topological tree (also referred to as a Game tree) is simply a
collection of nodes which are connected together by branches in a way that
looks like a tree:  every node has at most one predecessor (parent), and exactly 
one node (the root node) has no predecessors.  
The Game tree represents a sequence of choices in the
chronological order that they occur.

The Gambit Project is a project for the development of computer code
for the solution of extensive and normal form games.  The software
developed under the project is public domain. The Gambit Project has been
funded in part by National Science Foundation grants SBR-9308637 and
SBR-9617854 to the California Institute of Technology and SBR-9308862
to the University of Minnesota.</para>

      <para>
The Gambit Project was founded in the mid-1980s by Richard McKelvey.
The original implementation was a graphical interface written in
BASIC.  The code was ported to C around 1990 with the help of
Bruce Bell, and this version was distributed publicly as
version 0.13 in 1991 and 1992.
	</para>

      <para>
A major step in the evolution of Gambit took place with the awarding
of the NSF grants in 1994, with McKelvey and Andrew McLennan as
principal investigators.  The grants sponsored a complete rewrite
of Gambit in C++, with the code taking essentially the organization it
has today.  The graphical interface was made portable across
platforms through the use of the wxWindows library
(<ulink url="http://www.wxwindows.org">http://www.wxwindows.org</ulink>),
and a scripting language,
the Gambit Command Language, was developed.  Version 0.94 of Gambit
was released in the late summer of 1994, and version 0.96 followed in 1999.

Many other individuals have contributed to the project, by coding,
documenting, and testing, especially students at Caltech and the
University of Minnesota.  We wish to acknowledge their contributions
alphabetically here:

The project especially wishes to thank Bernhard von Stengel,
of the London School of Economics,  
for help and advice on implementation of the sequence form
and for contributing his &quot;clique&quot; code for identification of
equilibrium components in two person games.

      <para>
This manual documents version 0.97 of Gambit.  With this version,
the goal is to move Gambit towards the development and release practices
of other Open Source software projects.  Therefore, releases will take
place more frequently, with unstable releases being made publicly
available for testing.  The goal will be to provide two stable releases
a year, roughly coinciding with university semesters.
	</para>

      <para>
Beginning with version 0.97, Gambit releases will be numbered
0.x.y.z, with x denoting the major version, y the minor version, and
z the patchlevel.  For historical reasons, the version number will
always be preceded by the zero.  Whether a release is considered
stable will be indicated on the Gambit website, and in the 
<guimenuitem>About</guimenuitem> menu item on the 
<guimenu>Help</guimenu> menu in the graphical interface.
      </para>

      <para>
The initial release of version 0.97 improves upon 0.96 in two main
ways.  First, the graphical interface has been reimplemented in
version 2.2 of the wxWindows library.  This redesigned library offers
more functionality than the 1.xx series used in previous releases,
and therefore the graphical interface has been updated to reflect
modern practices in user interface, menu layout, and so forth.  These
changes should eliminate many of the misfeatures of the earlier versions
of the graphical interface.  Secondly, the structure of the project
files has been reorganized to bring it more in line with the practices
of most Open Source projects, a process which will continue over the
next several releases.  The goal is to make the internal API accessible
enough for use in developing new tools for game theoretic analysis.
For version 0.97, there are no significant changes to the command language
itself.  A console-based binary can now be built under Windows for
better scripting support on that platform, and a new cross-platform
window interface is provided, replacing the MFC-based interface for
Windows in version 0.96.

    <sect1><title>Getting and installing Gambit</title>
      <para>
The development and testing of Gambit takes place primarily
on the following platforms:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      Microsoft Windows 95, 98 and NT, using the free Borland C++ 5.5
	      compiler.  The binary distributions for Windows should work on
	      other versions of Windows, but may not be tested.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>
	      RedHat Linux 6.x and 7.x, using the GTK toolkit and the latest
	      version of <application>gcc</application>.  The wxWindows library
	      also supports Motif/Lesstif, and the code should compile
	      on other flavors of Linux and Unix; again, however, these
	      may not be tested.
	      </para>
	    </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	The latest stable and unstable releases of Gambit can always
	be found at the Gambit website at
	<ulink url="http://www.hss.caltech.edu/gambit">http://www.hss.caltech.edu/gambit</ulink>.
      </para>

    <sect1><title>Contacting or contributing to the Gambit Project</title>
      <para>
	All email correspondence to the Gambit Project can be addressed to
	<email>gambit@hss.caltech.edu</email>.  We welcome all manner of
	suggestions, including feature requests, documentation improvements,
	bug reports, bug fixes, and interest in contributing new code to
	the Gambit library.
      </para>

      <para>
	If you encounter a bug in Gambit, we want to hear about it.
	It will be most helpful if, in reporting your problem, you
	include the following information:
	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The version number</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The platform(s) on which you experienced the problem</para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>As complete a description of the circumstances of the
	      problem as possible.  It is especially helpful if you can
	      provide a sequence of steps which reproduces the problem.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>
	</para>

      <para>
	Currently, there is no formal techincal support for Gambit.
	However, the developers try very hard to respond to user comments
	and suggestions, and will make every effort to answer any questions
	regarding the program and its documentation.
	</para>

      <para>
	We hope you will find Gambit to be a useful tool for research and
	instruction.

<title>About this manual</title>

<para>
This manual is written with the assumption the reader is familiar with
the basic terms and concepts of game theory.  Where possible, Gambit
uses terminology standard in game theory; definitions of game-theoretic
concepts will only be introduced where confusion may occur.  
Game theory novices should supplement this manual with a standard text
on the topic; a list of some of these is given in the
<xref linkend="bib">.
</para>

<para>
Beginning with version 0.97, the Gambit manual is written using DocBook.
This manual can always be browsed online at the Gambit website, and can
be downloaded in HTML and PDF formats for local use.
</para>

<note>
<title>Changes from previous versions</title>
<para>
This manual, particularly the graphical interface sections, has been
substantially overhauled since the last release.  As a result, it is
still in flux.  Please report any areas in which the manual is unclear
or lacking to the Gambit address.
</para>
<para>
Throughout the manual, changes from previous versions are highlighted
in notes, such as this one.

<para>
This chapter documents the interface to the libraries which represent
and manipulate games in Gambit.

<para>
Currently, this codebase can be used three ways in programs:

<para>
The underlying C++ library can be called by other programs written
in C++, or which understand C++ calling conventions;

Many functions are now present in the Gambit
Python extension module.
(New for version 0.97.1, support still incomplete)

</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
Other languages supported by SWIG are also possibilities for future
API availability; please contact the Gambit development team if you
have interest in using Gambit in conjunction with another language.

<para>
Some parts of the C++ and Python APIs are in flux.  In these cases,
consult the
code or the Gambit development team for information about the C++ and/or
Python versions of such functions should you need them.   We are hoping
to continue to stabilize the API so it will be more possible to use
the Gambit code in other applications; however, there are still no
guarantees any particular feature will remain unchanged from version
to version.  Again, if you're using Gambit code directly, keep in touch
with the Gambit team directly or via the mailing lists for the latest
information and plans.
</para>

<para>
Note that beginning with version 0.97.1, the Gambit Command Language is
no longer included.  For the foreseeable future, Gambit will continue
to be able to read files generated by versions 0.97.0.3 and earlier;
therefore, you can still use command language scripts written for those
versions to build and manipulate games that will be accessible to the current
codebase.

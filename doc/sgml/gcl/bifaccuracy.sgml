<para>
<function>Accuracy</function> returns the accuracy of
<parameter>profile</parameter>.  The accuracy is the error
that is allowed in the computation of which Nash refinements
the profile satified.  Thus, if the profile is marked as
Nash, then no deviation by any player can yield an improvement
of more than the returned accuracy.

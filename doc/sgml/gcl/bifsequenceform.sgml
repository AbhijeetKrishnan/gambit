<refsect1><title>Description</title>
<para>
<function>SequenceForm</function> 
returns the sequence form of an extensive form game <parameter>efg</parameter>, where
the sequence form is as defined in Koller, Megiddo and von Stengel
<citation><xref linkend="KolMegSte94"></citation>.
The sequence form is returned as a nested list,
with the indices in the reverse order from the numbers of the players.
Thus, if there are three players, the (i,j,k)th element is a
vector of payoffs for player 3's ith sequence, player
2's jth sequence, and player 1's kth
sequence.  The components of the payoff vectors are in the same order
as the player numbers.

<para>
<function>PossibleNashSupports</function>
returns the list of supports that could be the supports of Nash
equilibria.  Specifically, the supports returned are those in which no
pure strategy is weakly dominated by another strategy in the support,
since such a pure strategy would have a lower expected payoff for any
mixed strategy vector that assigned positive probability to all
elements of the support and no other strategies, and no pure strategy
in the support is strictly dominated (relative to the support) by a
pure strategy outside the support.
